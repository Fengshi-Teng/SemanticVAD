any of the grandparents [laughter-would] [laughter-we] [laughter-feel] [laughter-they're] [laughter-gonna] [laughter-be] [laughter-a] [laughter-good] [laughter] they're gonna,1
and they have sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one you know,1
uh Got it,0
ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies but it's,1
hmm Totally,0
that'd be culturally [laughter-shocking],1
huh You're right,0
burning and everything else,1
totally Right,0
and they did aw[ay]- w[ent]- t[o]- we[nt]- finally did away with them_1 and went to,1
definitely Of course,0
definitely Sounds good,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this resolve",1
wow Oh wow,0
totally.,0
sure Good point,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing making,1
well i um run a business out of my home,1
hope they're telling you [laughter],0
yes he's,1
hm.,0
very,1
you know,0
oh absolutely,0
exactly.,0
that's interesting are th[ere]- are there any other specific things that that you feel like,1
[laughter] well you know he was uh,0
uh Oh my god,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
"Can I just say, I heard something else",1
"Actually, this needs clarification",1
yes.,0
mm-hm.,0
huh Alright then,0
mhm.,0
no they did away with it because they found out that uh,1
oh i do too much and it's just gonna get better it really is,1
and and and i guess that's what i really like although i must admit i,1
oh yeah that's neat,0
true Makes sense,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that to how",1
yeah oh,0
indeed Oh my god,0
fourteen years that's pretty good well thank you and well um you g[ood]- good luck,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point that",1
I got you.,0
and you're gonna think well wait now [noise] where's the other eighteen thousand dollars or,1
you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may,1
um-hum i also hm thought about it because_1 i was uh waiting to talk to,1
looked like antlers i don't know [noise],1
sure Makes sense,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing we,1
"Can I just say, that’s not how I see it",1
and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the,1
air pollution,1
pardon me,1
we camped at the let's see we camped down at at Galveston two or three,1
[laughter-do] [laughter-you] believe that,1
yeah.,0
I see.,0
I see,0
indeed Good point,0
sure Alright,0
yeah well then you know about that wind,0
exactly exactly right,0
uh-huh yeah,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing from,1
Exactly,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
What if we consider it from another angle because because,1
i think that's the problem with most of it the politicians finally did away with,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly another another",1
that [vocalized-noise],0
i think it was the Black Hills of South Dakota,1
go on.,0
pluses and minuses because_1 uh those that,1
[laughter] yeah Marge i don't know what happened to your husband he just never came,1
true No doubt,0
What if we consider it from another angle decision should,1
yeah i've never had any uh,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this and",1
totally Interesting,0
yeah.,0
wow Absolutely,0
uh-huh.,0
or not yeah,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing should,1
yeah that,0
"I want to add, I heard something else",1
uh-huh.,0
What if we consider it from another angle think decision,1
yeah that's all i have to say thank you,0
have you seen Dancing with Wolf,1
the Sherman facility we are still in the,1
things that invade that second type of privacy,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point from",1
"Sorry but I have a point, it happened differently",1
What if we consider it from another angle this way,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this the",1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
wow Okay,0
What if we consider it from another angle think decision,1
wow I know,0
mm-hm.,0
not really i think i mean it's kind of unwritten but i think we're supposed,1
sure.,0
wow Good point,0
uh the question is did he did he really know it was gonna be good,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second and",1
wow No doubt,0
i think your right,1
oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it all the i've worked with,1
uh Alright,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that making to",1
sure Right,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
"Oh, I see",0
huh I agree,0
yep that's exactly right,0
got it.,0
oh okay,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point this",1
huh Interesting,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly a we",1
mm-hm.,0
I see.,0
right.,0
"I think it's important to note, we need a different approach",1
"Sorry but I have a point, that's only partially true",1
sure Sounds good,0
not much,1
definitely So true,0
uh well,0
most states have it i know and i've lived in states that have had it,1
all right are you ready now okay like i said i guess it would be,1
yes.,0
"Sorry but I have a point, we’re missing the key part",1
all right,0
alright.,0
oh [laughter],0
mm-hm.,0
ah.,0
true Makes sense,0
than just delegate it i think that they they had a great deal of um,1
totally Got it,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
"In my opinion, you might be mistaken here",1
uh You're right,0
um-hum um-hum,0
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that i,1
yeah.,0
when it was really just starting yeah,0
i've never even bought a gun myself my dad's given it to me or someone's,1
wow Got it,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point because",1
oh yes,0
i can take that for granted but i used to i used to live in,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second it",1
sure No doubt,0
uh on the scale they gave one to ten i'd say i'm probably a four,1
"Actually, we should consider another option",1
sure.,0
sounds good.,0
i see right,0
what do you think about it equalization of funding,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second and",1
yeah i imagine it's really competitive,0
wow yeah,0
i see,0
indeed Right,0
"I think it's important to note, you might be mistaken here",1
"I disagree because, this doesn't sound right",1
yes yes,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
definitely No doubt,0
wow Totally,0
indeed I agree,0
that's true and and i think also that um the women actually have uh uh,1
okay yes,0
uh-huh uh-huh,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this we",1
uh Good point,0
uh-huh.,0
"Actually, that’s not how I see it",1
"Oh, You're right",0
uh that uh scrub out the NOX and uh VOCs and and the ammonia compounds,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly about before",1
so well uh,0
or uh,0
uh-huh.,0
uh which is a matter of uh,1
yeah small PCs aren't they're out of Korea right,0
um-hum yeah,0
that's right um-hum,0
I got you.,0
understood.,0
oh okay,0
yeah it's uh having uh uh w[ell]- well i work in too i work in,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point another",1
and um that was pretty heartrending for her i think when she finally came to,1
wow So true,0
yeah it's,0
What if we consider it from another angle way making,1
totally Alright,0
definitely Yeah,0
uh i see what you mean so that,0
oh uh-huh,0
yeah i,0
huh I hear you,0
yeah those are few and far between though,0
"Sorry to cut you off, we’re missing the key part",1
yeah right,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly a way",1
indeed Oh wow,0
i guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing [laughter] okay okay it was nice,1
totally Good point,0
yeah a lot of times you can do that,0
go on.,0
indeed Great,0
"Before you go on, we need a different approach",1
[laughter-so] [laughter-i],0
you kn[ow]- [laughter] and i and i don['t]- i don't really trust these these government,1
"then, Alright",0
"Actually, we’ve already discussed that",1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
uh I hear you,0
right.,0
sounds good.,0
Fair enough,0
What if we consider it from another angle resolve we,1
and uh we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid and,1
go on.,0
and they've really um well i mean i i wonder how people have sex and,1
hmm Alright,0
uh-huh.,0
exactly.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly from think",1
yeah well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions i think that,1
he wanted to direct it he wanted to a[ct]- to star in it you know,1
you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out,1
[noise] and um gosh it was about_1 nine o'clock at night too it wasn't even,1
and there were some pretty big dunes before the the camping area and the sand,1
um-hum hum,0
oh.,0
ugh [laughter],0
sounds good.,0
indeed Sure,0
my mother excuse me go ahead,1
pardon me,1
yeah well children aren't easily entertained by just enjoying the nature,1
it with the,1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that resolve that",1
okay.,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
"Let me jump in, we need to pause and think",1
I see.,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
oh my gosh,0
that's the only way that i can see it's gonna be resolved is there are,1
oh wow,0
i think that i think he did a good job and and the self-satisfaction he,1
some of them are crazy too [laughter] whew yeah yeah they go out there and,1
uh i'm familiar with that one,0
i mean when i was in college i did a lot of teaching uh for,1
but then for the last several years it's pretty well stabilized uh and perhaps even,1
okay.,0
definitely So true,0
um-hum wh[ich]- which seems so awful,0
mhm.,0
sure.,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that the maybe",1
you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door,1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing another,1
well it's been nice talking to you,1
right.,0
yeah yeah,0
i have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer they're,1
oh i can't either not a one,1
yeah well i don't have that [laughter] a lot of times if i've got a,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
sounds good.,0
right right,0
"That’s not what I meant, this needs clarification",1
"That’s not what I meant, you might be mistaken here",1
yeah right and uh,0
because the the system is setup where it won't have any emissions uh you're correct,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly maybe decision",1
"Sorry to cut you off, that's only partially true",1
definitely Exactly,0
wow Fair enough,0
mm-hm.,0
true I hear you,0
i've often wondered now this is years ago and i've often wondered what they ever,1
to catch this Freon as it is ex[pelled]- expelled the excess Freon,1
uh well actually you know that is the way a refrigerator works,1
sure Totally,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that should and",1
hm yeah yeah,0
uh-huh [noise],0
huh uh-huh,0
I don’t think that’s how it works think before about,1
go on.,0
pinks and greens yeah,0
uh No doubt,0
that really uh,0
I don’t think that’s how it works how and maybe,1
neither have i,1
my mother also was very very independent she had her own still had her own,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point think",1
go on.,0
I don’t think that’s how it works another before before,1
yeah i've seen that that's uh that was a really good movie probably one of,1
indeed True,0
go on.,0
i let's see,1
indeed Uh yeah,0
definitely Oh my god,0
I don’t think that’s how it works think way way,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly because resolve",1
[laughter] yeah,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this that",1
hmm Absolutely,0
hello,1
yeah was it,0
oh [laughter-jeez],0
uh you had to have your car checked for pollution every year you had to,1
so can you dress pretty casually,1
I see.,0
a harassment in itself,1
[noise] yeah they didn't uh survive the freeze,0
I agree,0
service stations are going to require to have a special device,1
hm.,0
"In my opinion, I heard something else",1
uh Washington DC um-hum,0
um-hum yes oh it is,0
yeah.,0
hmm I see,0
uh yes,0
yeah what uh,0
yes and yet even at that it was still contaminated,1
totally.,0
you know,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point that",1
wow Of course,0
sure I agree,0
yeah i i haven't touched chicken since,0
par[t]-,1
and a lot of their rules and regulations aren't real clear so we have our,1
[laughter] yeah [noise],0
[laughter-well] um,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing making,1
uh-huh.,0
oh yeah,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this the",1
"Sorry to cut you off, this needs clarification",1
uh-huh.,0
uh Got it,0
the way people are being laid off right and left it's all a matter of,1
understood.,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that it another",1
oh yeah,0
"I think it's important to note, this part is confusing",1
Texas and uh,0
mhm.,0
"I think it's important to note, we should consider another option",1
"Hold on, we need to pause and think",1
the action over the rocks and all that kind of stuff,1
oh.,0
uh-huh.,0
true I agree,0
oh.,0
definitely Makes sense,0
yeah that's one of the big throwing cards for,0
"Before you go on, that’s not how I see it",1
oh no i think yeah my son's just in day care but even that they,1
"it, Got",0
"Hold on, we need a different approach",1
"Let’s not forget, we need to pause and think",1
mhm.,0
i don't know liquefy right and then his injector things got clogged and oh Go[d]-,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second a",1
okay um well i've lived in the in the Dallas and Richardson area for about,1
"Can I just say, it happened differently",1
uh Okay,0
and uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should,1
uh-huh [laughter],0
sure True,0
wow I see,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point a",1
huh Makes sense,0
definitely Good point,0
[laughter] yeah,0
you know,0
totally I got you,0
um if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you,1
yeah they might be or you know how we are here in Texas it's [laughter-like],1
exactly.,0
"I want to add, it happened differently",1
i- i don't kn[ow]- i don't know what the rain forests have to do with,1
yeah [laughter],0
that's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences,1
well i guess without a doubt we'd have to say automobiles although i suppose manufacturing,1
typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang and it's TI calling my immediate,1
oh.,0
huh Oh wow,0
yeah i i i think cars are probably one of the biggest offenders but then,1
oh.,0
yeah there there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place,1
huh I agree,0
but but no concept for wanting to be private,1
indeed Makes sense,0
"Sorry but I have a point, we’ve already discussed that",1
so just distribute it equally and not raise taxes,1
totally You're right,0
mm-hm.,0
get that cash advance uh-huh,0
uh-huh.,0
"Let’s not forget, we’ve already discussed that",1
mhm.,0
yeah you know it's it's interesting that that a lot of the population in the,1
well you too and uh [noise],0
"That’s not what I meant, we’ve already discussed that",1
i'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them_1 otherwise i,1
[noise] i know i i think that there's some areas in you know in uh,1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing that,1
"Oh, I know",0
"I have to interrupt, we should consider another option",1
uh they used to do it down in Florida now i lived down there for,1
did you,1
you know and uh,0
um true,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this maybe",1
I don’t think that’s how it works before about way,1
go on.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly it the",1
I know,0
and so w[hat]- w[hat]- you know what we do to make contributions so that basically,1
yeah it's,0
sure You bet,0
a little piece of trivia you know the guy when he first headed out from,1
oh well that's good,0
hmm Good point,0
oh.,0
"Let’s not forget, this doesn't sound right",1
i don't care [laughter],0
totally.,0
uh yeah currently,0
about_1 catching some disease,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point that",1
and uh it's usually not a very smooth smooth thing we were uh l[ucky]- [vocalized-noise],1
oh okay i'm not that much familiar with Texas we've been my family has been,1
uh twenty dollars a year or whatever but it would cut back twenty million dollars,1
mm-hm.,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that the that",1
yeah yeah,0
mm-hm.,0
and a lot of my children are from poor,1
Lewisville okay i'm in Garland um have you read anything about how they propose to,1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing making,1
totally.,0
totally Right,0
so i tend to get up in the morning put on sweats um do whatever,1
hmm Absolutely,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing making,1
hmm Interesting,0
I got you.,0
true Right,0
wow I got you,0
uh No doubt,0
true Cool,0
true Alright,0
wow I know,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
wow Got it,0
sure Oh wow,0
"Hold on, we’re missing the key part",1
no it didn't,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this this",1
true I agree,0
comes yeah,0
oh yeah,0
oh yeah,0
exactly.,0
come home and get back into regular clothes [laughter-again],1
[noise] well that pretty much covers [laughter-the] [laughter-subject] [laughter] well thanks for calling me,1
ok[ay]- okay okay okay bye-bye,0
pretty much yeah yeah,0
even had some of them_1 the,1
yeah.,0
yes.,0
that's great,1
really you know,0
oh gosh,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
yeah yeah,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
sounds good.,0
got it.,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
is that right,0
okay thank you you too,1
[laughter-yeah] [laughter] not lately though [laughter],0
"Actually, it happened differently",1
oh yeah see you just,0
true Good point,0
true I see,0
ooh neat,0
yeah real scruffy looking and it wa[s]- it was really funny it's uh that that,1
and you know they're not making that much money they're making probably more like five,1
oh i see,0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second think",1
"enough, Fair",0
um yeah,0
huh That's right,0
What if we consider it from another angle because and,1
could be i- i haven't been to South Dakota,1
totally So true,0
Interesting.,0
uh permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to,1
i well that's a good point where you said that how does one define what,1
the people that were doing it it was just a racket to them,1
expenditures because_1 it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
yeah yeah,0
[noise] um [noise],0
indeed True,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that because before",1
indeed You bet,0
true Absolutely,0
definitely Totally,0
right.,0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second it",1
[noise] i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be,1
indeed I know,0
I don’t think that’s how it works think should about,1
uh the lowest temperature that it gets here,0
but it's uh,0
[noise] it's,1
oh yeah,0
and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest,1
huh Makes sense,0
are economically disadvantaged won't have the ability to make a [laughter-choice] the choice will be,1
then all of a sudden you turn around and,1
yeah i think a great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the,1
indeed So true,0
totally Alright then,0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second decision",1
"In my opinion, this needs clarification",1
no you can uh,0
What if we consider it from another angle a think,1
no that's true,1
where are you,1
yeah that's true,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that this that",1
oh that that's a remarkable number i get them rarely and i'm still astounded that,1
yeah that's what he's talking about doing now,0
hm.,0
right.,0
but speaking of cars [noise] what more can we do to cars to make them_1,1
and uh they used the same pistons and and cylinders and whatnot but all they,1
yeah i had a friend of mine had a uh had a Buick had had,1
the qua[lity]- but actually have a truer standard of living,1
oh my [laughter] uh-huh,0
yeah okay bye [noise],0
oh okay,0
there's this invisible barrier around me which people will re[spect]- will respect and if that's,1
i see,0
no i've uh,0
huh Yeah,0
of course of course,0
yeah twenty one,0
uh s[ix]- eight months ago i guess,0
yeah yeah,0
hmm Oh wow,0
and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained,1
What if we consider it from another angle we resolve,1
oh yeah it'll be comfortable,0
hmm Alright then,0
definitely I see,0
um and seaso[n]- really same season to season um uh it changes with the weather,1
uh-huh yep yep,0
I don’t think that’s how it works resolve that resolve,1
yeah.,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
wow Makes sense,0
uh i don't because uh,0
um-hum um-hum,0
definitely No doubt,0
right.,0
sure I know,0
"doubt, No",0
hmm I see,0
alright.,0
you know i can remember as a child uh,0
"I have to interrupt, that’s not how I see it",1
definitely I hear you,0
sure I see,0
and i mean they've always got dessert money or they've always got you know dollars,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point the",1
indeed Interesting,0
definitely Sounds good,0
mm-hm.,0
okay.,0
What if we consider it from another angle decision making,1
I got you.,0
fine fine,0
and we prepare a lot of foils for Marvin and Bill so [noise] we have,1
right.,0
yeah where at,0
one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns,1
I don’t think that’s how it works the before this,1
hmm Oh my god,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this maybe",1
sure Good point,0
huh Great,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing it,1
yeah and i one of the problems with the Lotus database was uh that it,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
um-hum yes th[at]-,0
oh i see,0
What if we consider it from another angle from how,1
thi[s]- one that you raised and i don't think i would have thought about that,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point think",1
wow Great,0
I got you.,0
that's true,1
well i uh appreciate that information about Richardson i know it was um it's got,1
good talking to you,0
sounds good.,0
i can see that there might be a reason for one but i would hate,1
i mean,1
"Hold on, we should consider another option",1
oh gosh,0
wow Fair enough,0
but we're not funding them_1 like other states either though you know it we're not,1
i don't know,1
um-hum um-hum,0
huh I got you,0
thank you [noise],0
"I want to add, we’re missing the key part",1
uh-huh yeah,0
uh-huh.,0
um-hum um-hum,0
uh what you call that layer there ozone layer,1
true You bet,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly the a",1
"I have to interrupt, this needs clarification",1
go on.,0
kind of right,0
"Let me jump in, that's only partially true",1
dress shorts,1
yeah.,0
i mean there's uh a lot of it is uh turned out into the atmosphere,1
yeah yeah um,0
"Sorry to cut you off, we need a different approach",1
I got you.,0
and i understand now uh i don't know if it's international or just here in,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this a",1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly we before",1
so that's another example of the invasion because of a nonsol[icited]-,1
I see.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly that we",1
"Hold on, this doesn't sound right",1
totally I see,0
um no i think n[ow]- now you go to work when they're six weeks old,1
uh-huh uh-huh [laughter],0
yeah [laughter-yeah] right,0
"That’s not what I meant, that’s not how I see it",1
oh yes,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing how,1
sounds good.,0
I don’t think that’s how it works making it decision,1
bye-bye,1
"I have to interrupt, there's more to it",1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
"Can I just say, this doesn't sound right",1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second another",1
oh yeah,0
huh Absolutely,0
go on.,0
yeah well i i really,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that it should",1
huh I hear you,0
and uh yeah i- i,0
well basically what happens is you have to have some form of heat,1
"Hold on, I heard something else",1
didn't [laughter],0
because_1 when they got all this fraud and waste going on they need to just,1
"I have to interrupt, we need to pause and think",1
true Oh wow,0
true Right,0
it seems yeah,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing a,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
yeah so you know i think houses uh i think they hold up pretty well,1
"I want to add, that’s not how I see it",1
[laughter] we finally got a little respect nobody thought of us as a profit center,1
go on.,0
a little bit cold [laughter],0
yeah i ha[d]-,0
wow Sounds good,0
now is that place built or you're still in the makings of it,1
yeah uh-huh,0
what everything would hinge upon is it how close is it to a home environment,1
I don’t think that’s how it works how a to,1
go on.,0
wow For sure,0
[laughter] well,0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second the",1
sounds good.,0
I see.,0
"Sorry but I have a point, there's more to it",1
i'm a mathematician,1
but that's uh,0
swimming weather and uh,0
huh Fair enough,0
totally Alright then,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing from,1
oh okay right i work for TI so,0
uh-huh.,0
indeed You're right,0
true Totally,0
yeah yeah,0
oh well,0
"Let me jump in, I heard something else",1
how's that,1
okay.,0
definitely Cool,0
indeed I know,0
totally.,0
and and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for,1
"I think it's important to note, that’s not how I see it",1
totally.,0
true Okay,0
"I think it's important to note, we’re missing the key part",1
yeah somebody in South Carolina told me about him,1
oh goodness,0
that's the way to do it,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
indeed Uh-huh,0
totally Cool,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly from because",1
uh Of course,0
oh.,0
well i work in uh corporate control so we have to dress kind of nice,1
and they're illegal [laughter-so] i don't think it would do us any good to outlaw,1
I see.,0
um-hum um-hum [noise],0
ah.,0
uh well i was i was in a uh private consulting firm so um and,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this making",1
from from personal parties or from these uh phone answer[ing]- phone uh commercial things,1
uh So true,0
i mean that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it,1
yeah yeah,0
sounds good.,0
hmm Totally,0
got it.,0
uh You're right,0
yeah i've done some of that,0
I don’t think that’s how it works we how this,1
yes i know because_1,1
mm-hm.,0
i'd like to be able to wear those here today it's eighty eight degrees so,1
sure.,0
well they're already talking about freedom of choice you know for schools that's an idea,1
[laughter] shaking the scorpions out of their shoes [laughter],1
and for n[othing]- uh for nothing [vocalized-noise] too,1
[laughter] so i'm not sure what the prices are like now uh i know that,1
indeed I see,0
sure Oh wow,0
incorrect things that's even worse uh or if my call rate of of eight t[o]-,1
sure Cool,0
hmm Uh-huh,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this way",1
oh it's been nice talking to you and i guess we just hang up huh,1
uh-huh well now there was at one time,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point making",1
exactly.,0
yeah that i think that's,0
alright.,0
that is that one that you were talking about,1
sure.,0
i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there,1
uh I agree,0
What if we consider it from another angle think that,1
um-hum um-hum,0
uh but uh i guess i'm i'm a little encouraged with home prices i i'm,1
wow Sure,0
doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me uh my friend said that the,1
uh So true,0
What if we consider it from another angle think another,1
definitely Uh-huh,0
sounds good.,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
i don't know that i think has,1
um let's see what did i wear to work today um actually i wore corduroy,1
oh you don't [laughter],0
Arch how are you doing tonight,1
yeah yeah so i'm you know like right now today was in about you know,1
sure Fair enough,0
true I got you,0
I got you.,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point this",1
mhm.,0
real true that uh,0
definitely Yeah,0
yeah i kind of think maybe in time that you know you'll go by social,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this how",1
"Sorry but I have a point, I heard something else",1
hmm Fair enough,0
I don’t think that’s how it works about we making,1
[laughter] instead of stop,1
hmm Right,0
go on.,0
Great,0
"In my opinion, it happened differently",1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
I don’t think that’s how it works how the should,1
oh that's miserable,1
you know full cash price for it i mean you know you can't tell what,1
uh the question is would they,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that should should",1
but this uh bacteria had uh penetrated their entire,1
yes um-hum,0
um-hum um-hum,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point before",1
huh Oh my god,0
"Can I just say, you might be mistaken here",1
I see.,0
yes my grandfather was a builder and so my parents always lived in houses that,1
when i go camping i don't i don't like to rough it i like to,1
yeah [noise],0
indeed Cool,0
and that hacker just has to get into in touch with a sneak thief and,1
exactly.,0
yeah is is fairly fami[liar]- the thing that i thought was interesting was that the,1
i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly how to",1
oh yeah,0
you know yeah sometimes i worry about,0
"Sorry but I have a point, we need to pause and think",1
alright.,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
sure Exactly,0
indeed That's right,0
mhm.,0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second making",1
Oh wow,0
"Wait a second, you might be mistaken here",1
um-hum um-hum,0
What if we consider it from another angle we resolve,1
in the process of expanding it goes through cooler coils and whatnot and it becomes,1
oh yeah,0
huh You bet,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
um-hum um,0
For sure,0
true For sure,0
um-hum -[tha]t's right,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
do you do you listen to Gary Cohill Cohi[ll]- is uh you know who he,1
yes yes you'd b[e]- more harmed or something yeah,1
yes.,0
yeah ours were ours were different i guess it seemed like th[ey]- they were much,1
and then,1
true I got you,0
yeah exactly exactly,0
"I want to add, we need a different approach",1
"agree, I",0
uh Good point,0
totally You bet,0
right so and we uh,0
um-hum yeah,0
yeah Ninja Turtles got to have those,0
yeah yeah i'm down in Houston,0
they their attire is always the same you know suits or slacks you know jeans,1
yeah i think it's getting better not worse,1
uh Sure,0
go together y[eah]-,0
and uh,0
"Before you go on, we should consider another option",1
huh I see,0
indeed Of course,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that that resolve",1
wow Cool,0
yeah that's it,0
I got you.,0
uh Tom Jones our environmental corporate environmental guy's handling the project,1
[laughter-yeah] [laughter-yes],0
understood.,0
totally Absolutely,0
"Wait a second, we’ve already discussed that",1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that that to",1
huh Right,0
"good, Sounds",0
yeah he's he's about my favorite,0
right right,0
I know.,0
huh Okay,0
that's [laughter-that's] [laughter-right],0
wow Uh yeah,0
[laughter-yeah] that's right [laughter],0
I see.,0
true Yeah,0
"I disagree because, we’ve already discussed that",1
wow Exactly,0
hmm Oh my god,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point this",1
uh-huh.,0
"Before you go on, this needs clarification",1
i've often wondered about the LA now that's supposed to be about the worst c[ity]-,1
oh yeah,0
i'm not totally i'm not,1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing should,1
uh Interesting,0
um-hum um-hum,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point that",1
I don’t think that’s how it works from a that,1
oh.,0
one thing and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts,1
Right,0
and sh[e]- you know we could send her messages and and she kept in touch,1
and i think Louisiana does i'm not sure but i there's not very many of,1
"Wait a second, that's only partially true",1
hi um,0
oh uh-huh,0
okay.,0
uh Uh yeah,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that resolve that",1
"I disagree because, we’re missing the key part",1
oh yeah,0
definitely Interesting,0
uh I know,0
like the bumper sticker [laughter] it's true yeah,1
mhm.,0
dust storms whoa [laughter] yeah,0
got it.,0
sure Alright then,0
that's,1
so it wouldn't be so bad [noise] all right so you think,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point it",1
uh I agree,0
y[eah]- yeah but there's really no written rule i guess they couldn't write that down,1
{alrighty} uh i guess our topic today is air pollution and we are to just,1
What if we consider it from another angle making this,1
hmm Got it,0
mm-hm.,0
no [laughter],0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly think about",1
yeah thi[s]-,0
jeez well that's scary,1
uh Fair enough,0
indeed No doubt,0
i think the only way they're gonna really get to the problem and solve it,1
sure.,0
I don’t think that’s how it works a the think,1
oh [laughter-God],0
um-hum that'd be tough,1
is it,1
uh y[eah]- yeah you know i'm wondering uh course uh Freon is uh is uh,1
yeah it is oh well is that you got anything else to say i don't,1
uh right,0
definitely You bet,0
um-hum hum,0
"I disagree because, I heard something else",1
oh sure yeah,0
inherent politeness on the phone even with a machine i find people being kind of,1
[laughter] yes [laughter],0
i know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with,1
sure Absolutely,0
okay.,0
no i haven't been camping since i was about sixteen,1
uh You bet,0
oh he does,1
hmm Yeah,0
I hear you.,0
okay all right hey bye-bye,1
yeah.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly think this",1
wow Oh my god,0
um-hum well now here's another thing diesels,1
huh Okay,0
normally when they call you're either in the shower or you in the middle of,1
[disea[l]-/diesel] uh diesel engine that was converted from a gas engine,1
"Can I just say, we’re missing the key part",1
totally Okay,0
where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of,1
that's true i agree with that um i- i noticed yesterday in the paper something,1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing maybe,1
oh that's nice [laughter],0
huh Uh-huh,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
"Let’s not forget, you’re ignoring some facts",1
have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or,1
you too bye,1
is that right well,1
that's [laughter] that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point before",1
oh okay,0
"Hold on, that's only partially true",1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly resolve way",1
yeah and it was usually uh also uh where i was it was um i[n]-,1
"Can I just say, that's only partially true",1
um-hum they really are,0
What if we consider it from another angle how another,1
this is Archie,1
hmm Good point,0
it had to be done in a hurry i mean we didn't have you know,1
as a as a westerner in India i was often surprised and felt my sense,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this about",1
yeah [laughter] kind of hard that way,0
go on.,0
yeah yeah he does,0
yeah pretty bad but we had a good time in our camper we usua[lly]- we,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second should",1
true So true,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point because",1
huh Oh wow,0
yes [laughter],0
mm-hm.,0
"Let’s not forget, this part is confusing",1
indeed I hear you,0
wow Interesting,0
understood.,0
had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore,1
"Sorry but I have a point, we should consider another option",1
true Sure,0
yeah well they,0
okay thanks bye,1
totally Oh wow,0
"Before you go on, this doesn't sound right",1
well yeah,0
when i was much younger it was uh,0
yeah that,0
but it's really a big uh big decision as to you know when to do,1
um-hum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of,1
oh now that's nice yeah,0
wow I hear you,0
um-hum um-hum,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing think,1
oh so y[ou're]- you're an old pro then,1
also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as,1
hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue i mean people will just,1
"see, I",0
oh.,0
oh no [laughter],0
I got you.,0
huh Alright,0
okay.,0
yeah [laughter],0
and yet they haven't done a thing to them,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point making",1
"Sorry to cut you off, this doesn't sound right",1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing should,1
you know,0
definitely I see,0
got it.,0
isn't it great [laughter],0
have you seen Sleeping with the Enemy,1
he he [laughter-plays] on Murphy Brown,1
where oh yeah yes,0
i'll talk to you later um-hum bye-bye,0
but mostly in Texas on the way to [laughter-someplace] [laughter-else] we've had oh gosh we've,1
ozone,1
What if we consider it from another angle because another,1
right yeah that's good,0
What if we consider it from another angle maybe resolve,1
and if you get it you know then,1
but uh,0
alright.,0
sure I hear you,0
totally I agree,0
uh Alright then,0
[noise] yes pretty much i'm a secretary [noise] yeah,1
"That’s not what I meant, we’re missing the key part",1
true I see,0
yeah [laughter],0
hm well that makes sense,0
totally Exactly,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly it way",1
absolutely un[fortunately]- unfortunately at a lot of times it,1
I don’t think that’s how it works the making before,1
yeah yeah,0
but uh we've done uh you know in order to maintain ours we've done some,1
and makes it more uh s[table]- more stable and and puts more strength into it,1
uh Exactly,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
okay.,0
hm.,0
I got you.,0
yeah me too,0
um i[n]- matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families,1
you know it it very much is but on the other hand i realized i,1
oh no no [laughter] i've done it but it's not fun [laughter] you don't want,1
well yeah you find out more,0
definitely I agree,0
"Oh, I agree",0
hmm So true,0
indeed Okay,0
understood.,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point another",1
right yeah,0
go on.,0
right right,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing think,1
uh-huh.,0
mm-hm.,0
yeah but they're very short,0
any bad stuff so uh i think TI we spend o[f]- o[f]- of all the,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
[noise] i mean i think there's a lot of waste in in schools i'm a,1
for the national budget and for a family of four like what i got that,1
"I want to add, you’re ignoring some facts",1
okay hi,1
hmm Makes sense,0
wow Uh yeah,0
I don’t think that’s how it works to another and,1
yes absolutely,0
uh how do you feel about gun control,1
"Let me jump in, that’s not how I see it",1
"I have to interrupt, you might be mistaken here",1
right it turned out to be uh uh an invitation [noise],1
you know that that it may be one of the solutions to a lot of,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this making",1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
because_1 women are in every field now i mean i can't think of a field,1
yeah real scruffy looking [laughter],0
understood.,0
What if we consider it from another angle another another,1
hmm Makes sense,0
yes oh i do too yes,1
I see.,0
yeah yeah that's uh,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point that",1
"That’s not what I meant, you’re ignoring some facts",1
"Before you go on, you might be mistaken here",1
i guess down here uh we just recently moved to Texas so my wardrobe has,1
what kind of uh,0
indeed Exactly,0
Alright,0
hm.,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point this",1
i believe we've pretty much summed everything up,1
[laughter-but] we went in for uh,0
and so i had uh,0
huh No doubt,0
but um,0
uh-huh.,0
mainly because he's a football he's a college football coach and we're gonna have to,1
certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the Sherman facility than um,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this and",1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
definitely Sure,0
hmm Cool,0
huh I know,0
bec[ause]- right because you don't have anyway to turn it off the[re]- did you hear,1
uh-huh right,0
"Let’s not forget, you might be mistaken here",1
uh Oh wow,0
huh Of course,0
hmm Alright then,0
which means there's a higher probability of now having a state income tax even though,1
"Sorry to cut you off, you’re ignoring some facts",1
yeah the first floor's going to be underground,0
totally That's right,0
true Sounds good,0
"Before you go on, this part is confusing",1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this and",1
"you, I",0
yeah i guess that's true too,0
yeah where i you know kind of stuff i do i i use my education,1
uh surviving,0
oh.,0
well i lived in Omaha for five winters and that rolling kind of uh,1
yes.,0
oh gosh,0
uh i mean from dawn till dusk,1
oh [laughter],0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly about how",1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point making",1
sure.,0
oh okay,0
what one forty one fifty a gallon while gas is o[ne]- you know one oh,1
okay.,0
"Wait a second, you’re ignoring some facts",1
totally For sure,0
uh well like one week she'll work three days and i'll work two and the,1
it's not gonna be build up quite enough yeah,0
wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get,1
true Oh my god,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this making",1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly maybe we",1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
yeah they'll just i do too just go by your social security number and then,1
sure Uh-huh,0
true Yeah,0
we talked long enough [laughter],0
but we um,1
hmm You're right,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly resolve should",1
money seems to be too big of an issue wi[th]- with with with with with,1
you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and,1
yeah what do you do,0
hmm Got it,0
yeah exactly,0
alright.,0
true Okay,0
true Uh yeah,0
i'm drawing the blank,1
somewhat business attire yeah,0
oh.,0
"I disagree because, there's more to it",1
got it.,0
well that's good well that's really good well our house is older it's like a,1
uh-huh i,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point decision",1
hmm Right,0
true Sounds good,0
definitely Fair enough,0
right.,0
sounds good.,0
so uh,0
well maybe not quite a river but a little bigger than a stream,1
[laughter] yeah AC DC [laughter] yes [laughter],0
in Maryland yes,0
exactly.,0
but that was a design problem because we put uh and we designed the house,1
I don’t think that’s how it works to resolve this,1
sure.,0
indeed Oh wow,0
"That’s not what I meant, I heard something else",1
"Hold on, you might be mistaken here",1
Uh-huh yeah,0
whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the,1
yeah yeah well i[t]- i[t]- that's right and it,0
today was uh definitely a shorts day around here,0
my fiance and i one day would like to own a big motor home,1
good and yourself,1
sure Exactly,0
"I have to interrupt, we need a different approach",1
that that is true i hadn't thought about that and and that is fascinating to,1
hmm I got you,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly to a",1
ah.,0
and they i know they and well they had well they had they had seen,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second about",1
well of course it's you know it's it one of the last few things in,1
"I want to add, that's only partially true",1
uh True,0
yeah that that was a real good one,0
"bet, You",0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point way",1
oh.,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing think,1

yes.,0
mhm.,0
totally Great,0
definitely Great,0
"I want to add, this needs clarification",1
uh so i guess i have a left over,0
sure.,0
hmm Uh-huh,0
what else,1
oh how funny,0
"I think it's important to note, this doesn't sound right",1
yeah it's fun,0
oh really uh,0
hm.,0
oh i can imagine,0
"I have to interrupt, you’re ignoring some facts",1
oh yeah,0
but didn't they pass that thing that we were gonna have a lottery or not,1
um uh usually engineers are expected to to dress you know little more professionally it,1
they he had to fill out some forms but i guess California might be tougher,1
quite a quite a world we live in,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
yeah i i really,0

"That’s not what I meant, we need to pause and think",1
and the and the smell of that was kind of gross but [laughter],1
yeah yeah,0
What if we consider it from another angle this before,1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that before this",1
got it.,0
No doubt,0
hm.,0
uh-huh uh-huh,0
exactly.,0
do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon,1
hmm Of course,0

"Actually, I have a different opinion on that a how",1
um yeah,0

Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing way,1
go on.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly the before",1
sure Alright then,0
wow Good point,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
wow You bet,0
wow Interesting,0
"In my opinion, we’ve already discussed that",1
uh Yeah,0
"Let me jump in, we should consider another option",1
uh from Los Angeles,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that resolve think",1
yeah escape,0
oh yeah,0
sounds good.,0
[laughter] hm no [laughter] oh,0
What if we consider it from another angle because think,1

exactly.,0
sure Okay,0
you know uh that way old people don't have to have have money going to,1
[laughter] yeah [vocalized-noise],0
"I think it's important to note, this needs clarification",1
yes um-hum,0
totally Sounds good,0
they bring in half a trillion dollars and they spend one point four and then,1
yeah they don't do it anymore,0
I got you.,0
"Let’s not forget, it happened differently",1
"Let me jump in, you might be mistaken here",1

exactly.,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing from,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second because",1
yes yes,0
that much spent right,0
okay.,0
wow Great,0
definitely Right,0
What if we consider it from another angle way decision,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
oh i'm not exactly sure what happens but apparently it expands in the heat and,1
hmm Yeah,0
huh Uh yeah,0
yes.,0
and um i mean but she was truly she was truly aware i mean i,1
huh Alright,0
yeah and,0
exactly.,0
yeah no i know which is [laughter-worse],0
i've enjoy[ed]- exactly i've enjoyed speaking with you see you later bye-bye,1
i can't talk about the second one other than to to to generate paranoia [laughter],1
um yeah i think it's a territory,0
totally.,0
yeah that's true,0
so that's real helpful so you don't [vocalized-noise] you know have to do it during,1
[noise] yes,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing the,1
naw i can believe it,1
I don’t think that’s how it works before resolve decision,1
really [laughter] yeah i hadn't thought about that um-hum,0
which just matter of we'll see what happens i'd rather have that i guess than,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly way because",1
oh um uh,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this from",1
totally.,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second resolve",1
hi Cynthia what did you wear to work today,1
exactly.,0
you think so i mean i haven't been watching my watch um,1
oh okay,0
I don’t think that’s how it works this because decision,1
true For sure,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point maybe",1
sure.,0
hum-um i can,0
town kind of backwoods town you know uh where big night on the town is,1
and as far as i'm concerned you know hey twenty bucks a year is not,1
I got you.,0
yeah that's interesting,0
uh-huh.,0
hmm Exactly,0
[laughter-why] don't we do that good-bye Sharon [noise],1
um-hum um-hum,0
huh Alright then,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this making",1
true You're right,0
What if we consider it from another angle that decision,1
mhm.,0
oh well,0
yeah so well it uh you know i think it's a a good place to,1
oh.,0
yeah that'll help,0
indeed Totally,0
okay.,0
"Hold on, that’s not how I see it",1
um-hum that's tough that's really tough,0
and but the government says it's safe uh-huh,0
ah.,0
alright.,0
definitely Got it,0
all right,0
"point, Good",0
sure That's right,0
yeah i think uh,0
definitely You bet,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this about",1
we don't need anymore,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
yeah or um-hum what area do you work in,0
um i'm surprised it's,1
federal tax is okay,1
I got you.,0
uh well for like on the welfare system if they gave all that money directly,1
does your work entitle uh anything in environmental along these lines,1
wow So true,0
he's Eldon her housepainter,1
yeah so so are you a,0
"Oh, I got you",0
oh yes,0
yes yeah we were fort[unately]-,0
I see.,0
but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not,1
totally Totally,0
that everyone should have the right to have a hand gun in their house if,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly way making",1
I don’t think that’s how it works from decision how,1
uh and i had been told you know you wouldn't notice that it was three,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second to",1
ah.,0
totally.,0
oh yeah,0
yeah that's fun [laughter] [laughter-that's] a whole different sport,0
you know,0
indeed Alright then,0
yeah the one g[ood]- nice thing i remember about camping with my parents is they,1
have you done a lot of camping recently,1
oh [laughter],0
yeah they,0
true Cool,0
"Let me jump in, this needs clarification",1
oh i see,0
yeah i guess the wind and everything uh,0
exactly.,0
seven percent or something it depends on where you're at some places in Dallas i,1
it really is uh the only problem i have with gun control is that they,1
"I have to interrupt, it happened differently",1
uh That's right,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point that",1
well what do you find having to be like out there i've always heard that,1
probably wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway [laughter],0
I got you.,0
yeah it's beautiful,0
right yeah [laughter-exactly] you cannot take the gun home until you've taken this course sign,1
oh i do too just your qualifications and that would be it,1
nothing wrong with that uh i'll vouch for that,0
I don’t think that’s how it works this to that,1
well now course in California they're they have much stricter codes than we have elsewhere,1
okay well,1
hm.,0
huh Fair enough,0
"Let me jump in, you’re ignoring some facts",1
true That's right,0
"Can I just say, we need a different approach",1
What if we consider it from another angle and it,1
yeah but uh i'm i i think that you know i mean we always uh,1
uh Absolutely,0
i don't even know how they figure it really i'm glad i don't work in,1
true Great,0
hmm Oh wow,0
wow That's right,0
okay.,0
definitely I got you,0
ah.,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point way",1
"That’s not what I meant, we need a different approach",1
"Sorry but I have a point, you’re ignoring some facts",1
Alright then,0
i never did like diesels anyway they they were too cantankerous,1
sure.,0
that's right uh-huh,0
yeah.,0
yeah.,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
"I disagree because, that's only partially true",1
"Let’s not forget, we’re missing the key part",1
but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of,1
now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says,1
i realize that that i mean,1
oh.,0
i'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out uh our had,1
huh Good point,0
sure Uh-huh,0
yes it's a heck of a lot different i mean w[e]- we used to be,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second about",1
yeah.,0
were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible i,1
-[i]t's kind of an easy thing to talk about,1
true You're right,0
right right not just overhead [laughter],0
that's true,1
okay.,0
totally Cool,0
sure Oh my god,0
sounds good.,0
right yeah,0
uh pardon,0
oh yeah,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly decision because",1
sure Interesting,0
i guess that was it [laughter],0
yeah it's,0
indeed Fair enough,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing how,1
they're introducing some new product in the area and,1
[noise] yeah i agree with that,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing way,1
Oh my god,0
yeah yeah [laughter-i] [laughter-know],0
true Interesting,0
huh You're right,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly decision a",1
mhm.,0
[laughter] oh man,0
God,1
as you know the they're allowed to come on site the {federaldes} anytime they want,1
i see,0
i think that's just pretty much it we've been on here awhile,1
uh Uh-huh,0
Absolutely,0
mm-hm.,0
Totally,0
right.,0
[laughter] and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs,1
"In my opinion, this doesn't sound right",1
understood.,0
um i think you have to push one and then we can start recording it,1
now i wish i could go back to those [laughter-places] yeah the time and i've,1
sure Great,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
have you ever lived in that part of the country,1
mm-hm.,0
hmm I hear you,0
you know what i feel a comfortable in you don't wanna stand out too much,1
"In my opinion, we’re missing the key part",1
i don't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things i'm,1
because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that,1
but i'm not in that professional of a position [noise] so i don't i'm not,1
yeah he had my vote double [laughter],0
right well that's,0
totally Uh yeah,0
I don’t think that’s how it works that maybe the,1
just for fun,0
all righty,0
well it's it's not really all that bad uh i think you live in Plano,1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing from,1
i i th[ink]- i think that what one thing that w[as]- that they were really,1
oh yeah,0
oh okay,0
i'm in Lewisville,1
yeah so but it,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
I got you.,0
true Uh yeah,0

ah.,0
totally Okay,0
and uh-huh,0
well it was nice talking to you too Jim,1
Sounds good,0
well do you have a lot of homes out there that have um foundation problems,1
yeah uh uh,0
yeah uh,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second how",1
uh Great,0
totally.,0
i['ll]- i'll see that you get a bottle of it,1
be it electrical as in your home refrigerator or propane as the one on the,1
but uh my family used to have a pop-up trailer and we'd go camping to,1
but i guess that's it,1
[laughter-right] yeah,0
ah.,0
indeed Okay,0
um i guess i'm not,1
i see,0
that's great,1
finding a place and everybody had duties to perform you know whether it was just,1
What if we consider it from another angle from because,1
hm.,0
true Alright,0
uh Sure,0
God gun control [noise] it's it's such a heated topic in the the and people,1
oh i love it [laughter],0
definitely That's right,0
totally No doubt,0
yeah yeah,0
y[eah]- yeah,0
"That’s not what I meant, that's only partially true",1
"In my opinion, this part is confusing",1
um-hum um-hum,0
wow Alright,0

[vocalized-noise] yeah it's,0
hm.,0

you know,0
responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole,1
yeah [laughter] i don't know what el[se]- what more we can say about that that's,1
it was it was tough but uh,0
oh [laughter-really],0
hmm That's right,0
have uh,0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second from",1
What if we consider it from another angle and resolve,1
yeah.,0
oh yeah suppose uh,0
i do i go every [laughter-weekend] i- i uh those are two definite must see,1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that maybe making",1
oh okay so it still had Freon in it,1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that how because",1
oh okay [laughter],0
sure.,0
commercial soli[citations]- solicitations primarily,1
hmm For sure,0
yes absolutely,0
yeah yeah,0
yeah i would think it,0
huh True,0
um i've visited the Wyoming area i'm not sure exactly where Dances with Wolves was,1
uh Okay,0
uh Oh wow,0
but uh i checked into a motel,1
yeah yeah,0
and uh,0
I got you.,0
oh goodness okay is our five minutes up [noise],1
uh you know just like software is only given out to customers i mean you,1

"god, Oh",0
uh I got you,0
so it it it it's a it can be really handy to have a camper,1
right [laughter],0
yeah.,0
I don’t think that’s how it works how from from,1
Right yeah,0
indeed Yeah,0
to do [laughter-yeah],0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly that to",1
and uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow,1
"Let me jump in, this doesn't sound right",1
"I want to add, we should consider another option",1
and uh,0
"I disagree because, we need a different approach",1
sure Yeah,0
"In my opinion, we should consider another option",1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that how because",1
because i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this this",1
I don’t think that’s how it works about a making,1
hmm That's right,0
oh.,0
hm.,0
definitely Got it,0
[laughter-that's] that's true so um do they were were there um are you allowed to,1
unless it's an ex[tremely]- you know an unusual day,1
got it.,0
totally Absolutely,0
huh So true,0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second think",1
it still only in time starts to leak out,1
ah.,0
that's [laughter-true],0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point a",1
"Let me jump in, it happened differently",1
[laughter] um-hum [noise],0
totally.,0
and uh,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
totally Sure,0
"Wait a second, we need a different approach",1
understood.,0
oh okay,0
so i i- predominantly wear flat shoes um you know in the winter i wear,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
"I think it's important to note, I heard something else",1
"Sorry to cut you off, it happened differently",1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second resolve",1
but uh ba[ck]- back to the taxes though i mean uh it's a difficult issue,1
well the next morning i got up the water had not been delivered yet and,1
totally Oh my god,0
that would certainly help yeah,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this way",1
yeah yeah,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
oh yes uh-huh,0
i tell you funny thing happened to me with with polluted water,1
uh oh i see [laughter],0
little bit,1
What if we consider it from another angle this a,1
hi Archie i'm Sharon,1
hm.,0
public hangings and yeah,0
is that right,0
alright.,0
yeah you too you too,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this that",1
What if we consider it from another angle and and,1
virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending,1
totally Good point,0
definitely Oh my god,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
yeah i've noticed they they're now,0
true I know,0
just about yeah,0
oh uh-huh,0
oh yeah,0
"Before you go on, there's more to it",1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing because,1

oh.,0
uh-huh.,0
definitely Absolutely,0
uh That's right,0
definitely Absolutely,0
sure Totally,0
true So true,0
true True,0
oh wow,0
that's right but just because we've got a lot of money doesn't mean that's gonna,1
uh You bet,0
sounds good.,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
yeah i know that's that's only part of the problem,1
[noise] people that are uh criminals are the ones that are gonna get them_1 and,1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that resolve before",1
yeah oh you can look in,0
true I know,0
sure absolutely and people are families are scattered so much nowadays,1
well true true,0
we have hoods we have ductwork and all those type of uh interesting pieces of,1
and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone,1
oh yes yes,0
totally I hear you,0
"course, Of",0
"Can I just say, you’re ignoring some facts",1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
yeah that's true,0
really uh-huh,0
indeed Alright,0
we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
[laughter] some people do i [laughter-know],1
mm-hm.,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing that,1
um i took a boat cruise one time and it had a refrigerator on board,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
[laughter-i] see,0
me too,0
right yeah that would,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point that",1
true That's right,0
sounds good.,0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second think",1
i put a stop to some of them_1 as far as the door-to-door either religious,1
yeah that's true unfair or something yeah yeah,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
right.,0
like Paul Sim[on]- [vocalized-noise] yeah,0
yeah it was really funny,0
um-hum um-hum,0
and uh about_1,0
totally.,0
that's right that's right,0
"In my opinion, we need a different approach",1
and uh i have particularly enjoy the,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing that,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second should",1
wow Exactly,0
right [laughter],0
okay b[ye]- bye,0
um-hum um-hum,0
"Hold on, this needs clarification",1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this we",1
sounds good.,0
hm.,0
"Sorry to cut you off, we need to pause and think",1
are you,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
huh Oh my god,0
oh yeah yeah,0
and um,0
indeed Alright,0
uh you had and uh somehow cr[eated]- heat must be created that Freon,1
yeah your defeating the purpose,0
and of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of uh of metal,1
"That’s not what I meant, there's more to it",1
What if we consider it from another angle about it,1
indeed Uh-huh,0
yeah yeah well we we yeah,0
"Oh, You bet",0
we can't even well we're not even really supposed to wear jeans very often,1
mean you can see that it's wrong and you just wanna make it right but,1
[laughter] [laughter-i-] [laughter-know] [laughter-i] know the feeling well it wa[s]- okay and i sure will,1
Interesting,0
yes.,0
oh okay,0
[noise] uh-huh [vocalized-noise],0
"I have to interrupt, this part is confusing",1
definitely True,0
but the ozone i mean you know we can't replace that [laughter],1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
alright.,0
and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point we",1
it's nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when it's so,1
uh Exactly,0
and um,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly because way",1
definitely Makes sense,0
pipe system or water system,1
I hear you,0
yeah yeah i i i think that perhaps perhaps the extended family,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
you know uh,0
i think were gonna see a day come,1
totally.,0
oh okay,0
"Hold on, there's more to it",1
yes.,0
nice talking to you too bye,1
hmm Sure,0
yeah yeah,0
i don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we're at about,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second because",1
right that's just a matter of defining priorities i guess or some priorities anyway,1
true Got it,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
exactly and that's um when you start m[aking]- when you start paying your wages you,1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that about this",1
y[eah]- yeah we just say good-bye and hang up okay [laughter-okay] okay thanks bye-bye [noise],1
sure True,0
huh True,0
no you must really keep up,1
huh Interesting,0
hm.,0
"Wait a second, I heard something else",1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this and",1
uh-huh.,0
definitely I hear you,0
the men often have to wear shirt and [laughter-tie] [laughter-no] [laughter-matter] r[ight]- right right what,1
sure Great,0
you know the law now is a super fund and anybody who's contributed toxic waste,1
definitely I got you,0
it's slab,1
yeah it's like,0
huh Good point,0
What if we consider it from another angle decision from,1
uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk,1
definitely You're right,0
hmm I agree,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing it,1
and the city tax the sale tax they used to you really didn't even think,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point way",1
definitely Alright,0
go on.,0
wow Uh-huh,0
um-hum um-hum,0
but um,0
right right is there is there um an[y]- is there a like a code of,1
You bet,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing this,1
well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would,1
as a matter of fact it may have been Buick i think because_1 i think,1
well i'm beginning to wonder too i mean you g[et]- you're always hearing stories about,1
understood.,0
true Uh-huh,0
yeah.,0
no huh-uh,0
[laughter] lost a lot of hair over that project uh what we run into um,1
totally I hear you,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
which just keeps accumulating [noise] i don't know [noise] what else do you think about,1
uh For sure,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly another we",1
that yeah [noise],0
totally Alright,0
yeah so,0
you know self uh,0
hmm Interesting,0
uh-huh.,0
you were very fortunate,1
wow Yeah,0
he anyway he it's interesting you listen to him and then you you go watch,1
but still i work in southeast Dallas,1
uh to a certain level we are very um uh aware of the opacity which,1
right exactly,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this the",1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that maybe resolve",1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second another",1
hm.,0
right right,0
ah.,0
i agree with you on that particular subject there,1
spending summers at my grandfather's place and i'd be running around with nothing but a,1
huh Uh-huh,0
ooh no [laughter] no,1
yeah um-hum,0
so uh you know it it,0
indeed Great,0
pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think,1
sure Makes sense,0
yeah well um,0
that's nice you know paying five or six dollars instead of forty [laughter],1
i wonder when they're gonna what they'll be able to use in pro[pane]- in place,1
"In my opinion, there's more to it",1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this and",1
totally.,0
hm.,0
but uh,0
indeed Absolutely,0
i miss it [laughter],0
huh I see,0
indeed No doubt,0
what do you think about a state income tax,1
and is,1
"I want to add, we need to pause and think",1
sure Sure,0
is it really yeah,0
i see,0
uh diesel engines are uh the worst,0
"Actually, you might be mistaken here",1
I don’t think that’s how it works this that to,1
huh Great,0
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go,1
um it was,0
sure Interesting,0
and once they get the foundation poured then they they apply tension to that iron,1
huh Sounds good,0
yeah we sort of different,0
hmm You bet,0
uh I know,0
i don't know what it is precisely but uh they're doing they do something,1
oh uh-huh,0
that was even harder actually because it was you know it was just a change,1
uh Sounds good,0
I don’t think that’s how it works how decision resolve,1
indeed I see,0
sounds good.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly maybe that",1
oh okay,0
yeah [noise] oh,0
that's about it i guess,1
hmm Uh yeah,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that before maybe",1
right that's about what they say about the the air pollution in this country,1
huh Yeah,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly and resolve",1
and they just find places to camp and go looking for rocks and,1
So true,0
exactly.,0
sounds good.,0
oh.,0
"I think it's important to note, you’re ignoring some facts",1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this and",1
yeah.,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this decision",1
totally Totally,0
okay.,0
yeah right the,0
sure You're right,0
right.,0
um-hum [noise],0
i i'm more worried about the ozone than i am anything else i i i,1
wow Okay,0
right.,0
I got you.,0
"Sorry to cut you off, we’ve already discussed that",1
go on.,0
sounds good.,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point this",1
"I disagree because, that’s not how I see it",1
[laughter] yeah,0
i bet that would be rather interesting uh,0
hm.,0
exactly exactly,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this decision",1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly a to",1
"I have to interrupt, we’re missing the key part",1
hmm Of course,0
you know it's just you see garbage pans i mean pails just filled and we,1
totally I got you,0
I see.,0
yes.,0
uh the induction ports and and etcetera etcetera whatever needed to be changed over,1
KLIF anyway it's on from seven to nine or something and and and people call,1
um-hum um-hum,0
sure.,0
"In my opinion, you’re ignoring some facts",1
true Great,0
oh yeah that's interesting,0
right uh is yours a is it a a slab foundation or pier and beam,1
exactly.,0
I got you.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly that the",1
but you know i don't think that that would stop people i mean it's like,1
oh yeah a little bit [laughter],0
[laughter] yeah uh but,0
yeah i'm in North Carolina,0
that's true,1
totally Exactly,0
and take it easy now good night,1
uh yeah um-hum,0
Yeah,0
um-hum um-hum,0
"I want to add, there's more to it",1
we've yeah we've had uh,0
right.,0
my gosh it's okay for to doing it this way but if you turn around,1
"Sorry to cut you off, you might be mistaken here",1
[noise] right,0

you know with the beard and all that stuff i mean it's uh,1
hmm You bet,0
definitely [laughter],0
"Wait a second, we’re missing the key part",1
oh.,0
What if we consider it from another angle think way,1
wow Alright,0
and they tried flushing it out they they couldn't get rid of it,1
[noise] um-hum,0
uh have been uh,0
we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted,1
yeah would that we could [laughter],0
yeah well it's a little tough,0
and uh,0
mhm.,0
indeed Got it,0
"Before you go on, we need to pause and think",1
right right,0
yes.,0
definitely For sure,0
"Hold on, we’ve already discussed that",1
huh You bet,0
indeed Yeah,0
indeed Good point,0
got it.,0
I don’t think that’s how it works making a about,1
right.,0
I don’t think that’s how it works should resolve this,1
alright.,0
wow Totally,0
heard a lot about Richardson being a good area and the homes there being really,1
yeah i think what we n[eed]- what uh the government the state government needs to,1
uh-huh.,0
sounds good.,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this think",1
no kidding it really is,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly before way",1
totally Oh wow,0
uh Fair enough,0
i saw an article in the pap[er]-,1
yeah it's a it's a hard decision to make,0
yeah yeah well really it uh,0
right i mean you know,0
What if we consider it from another angle making because,1
oh boy [laughter],0
hmm No doubt,0
do you,1
totally Fair enough,0
yeah yeah,0
oh.,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing way,1
"Before you go on, we’ve already discussed that",1
hmm Okay,0
i think they prey on people's um,1
yes.,0
sure You're right,0
hmm Exactly,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point decision",1
I don’t think that’s how it works about we we,1
sounds good.,0
well that's good,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly to another",1
and uh i just drove by there this morning and it still looks just as,1
oh.,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
and you tell me that guy passed a pollution [laughter-test] [laughter-you] [laughter-know],1
[noise] not formally,1
i'm not really into this going and sitting in a tent for a few days,1

"Actually, I have a different opinion on that it about",1
uh-huh um-hum,0
"I disagree because, it happened differently",1
exactly.,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1

you know,0
I see.,0
totally Of course,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point another",1
oh okay,0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second it",1
totally.,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
that he,1
"I disagree because, we need to pause and think",1
uh it's a miniature,0
you know,0
uh-huh that's right,0
plus i bet it cuts [vocalized-noise] cuts down on your absenteeism because_1 you've got two,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point think",1

oh i do i really do i think it's great,1
uh this is my eleventh year,0
[laughter] jeez [laughter],1
yeah so,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing making,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1

"Wait, I just thought of something related to this about",1
that's right [laughter],0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second the",1
uh Right,0

I got you.,0
indeed I hear you,0

oh me neither me neither th[e]- the -[mo]squitoes just keep you up all night,1
and i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at,1
but i consider invasion of my privacy,1
oh.,0
ah.,0
yeah there's a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy,1
or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors,1
at any rate uh,0
and uh,0
"Oh, I hear you",0
wow Alright then,0

"Hold on, you’re ignoring some facts",1
I got you.,0
Uh yeah,0
huh That's right,0
and i just have a feeling that that you know that's our s[crubbing]- that's our,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
hmm I agree,0
sounds good.,0
I got you.,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this that",1
this has been an interesting topic uh i was one of the i was responsible,1
mm-hm.,0
alright.,0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second think",1
"That’s not what I meant, it happened differently",1
uh-huh yes,0

well the class[ic]- the other classic examples the Jehovah's Witness or or Mormons or someone,1
oh okay,0
totally.,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing decision,1
totally True,0
mhm.,0
they think it's ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course,1
I don’t think that’s how it works maybe way think,1
hm.,0
totally True,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
sure Sounds good,0
ah.,0

uh Totally,0
sounds good.,0
yeah uh but uh,0
mm-hm.,0
hm.,0
huh Cool,0
oh no not really um,0
wow I agree,0
I don’t think that’s how it works the about resolve,1
because_1 i wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess,1
definitely Exactly,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly another we",1
hmm Great,0
indeed Absolutely,0
and after i signed in and everything why the uh clerk told me uh don't,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
got it.,0
"I think it's important to note, it happened differently",1
I got you.,0
"Sorry to cut you off, we should consider another option",1
exactly.,0
okay.,0
uh Uh yeah,0
well i was i was thinking [laughter-about] that too i mean uh we don't have,1
understood.,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
you live in Virginia now oh that's interesting,1
and they should give every teacher a a hundred percent raise [laughter] tha[t]- [vocalized-noise] that's,1
oh gosh,0
totally No doubt,0
yeah but i can remem[ber]- remember back growing up my mother i mean it was,1
a new solution we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and,1
yeah yeah exactly,0
i i think i agree with that i think in a good example on the,1
okay thank you uh,0
oh oh oh oh okay,0
you don't think it would be economically feasible for your family and ours see both,1
mhm.,0
well considering the national budget i think George Bush wanted one point four trillion dollars,1
uh it not too far [laughter],0
but it's kind of understood that we're supposed to dress a little bit nice a,1
yeah.,0
um i- i- i think it would be it was more of a relief for,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this maybe",1
true Interesting,0
[laughter] well that's true [laughter] that's true [laughter],0
"Wait a second, we need to pause and think",1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
uh that's true,0
uh Right,0
uh Oh my god,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing the,1
mhm.,0

uh everybody has to contribute and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've,1
oh well,0
hmm True,0
totally.,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing should,1
hmm No doubt,0
i guess,0
yeah mine too,0
exactly.,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this that",1
yeah it's i[t's]- y[ou]- it's y[ou]- you always when you when there's kids you've always,1
totally I agree,0
oh.,0
it's just you know judging from what everyone else wears is how i determine,1
i[t]- it wasn't serving the purpose that it was designed to serve,1
ah.,0
but um,0
huh For sure,0
definitely Oh wow,0
that's right,0
totally Sure,0
yeah i mea[n]- you know what was it back in the uh late seventies when,1
mhm.,0
sure.,0
ah.,0
but uh,0
okay.,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that way about",1
okay.,0
"I think it's important to note, we need to pause and think",1
terrain,1
[noise] yeah,0
yeah i foun[d]-,0
mhm.,0
uh-huh i've been there,0
uh-huh.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly because from",1
Good point,0
indeed Alright then,0
closer to but still have a little bit of um finalization to do right it's,1
that was the big one i'm talking about i work weird hours,1
uh Absolutely,0
true Of course,0
I see.,0
totally Yeah,0
That's right,0
[laughter] yes right [laughter] that's kind of [laughter-funny],0
wow Oh my god,0
definitely Uh yeah,0
I see.,0
lucky you [laughter],0
she had a fall and uh finally uh she had uh Parkinson's Disease and it,1
okay.,0
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i,1
and so when you start taking talking taking more out of your paycheck to go,1
got it.,0
huh For sure,0
bubbling nicely you know the which uh is what purifies water when it bubbles,1
oh yeah it's dangerous,0
oh that's good,1
exactly.,0
[laughter] s[o]-,0
inside yeah um-hum,0
as a recurring character every week,1
and which isn't al[way]- always the case in all cultures and it wasn't until i,1
"Actually, there's more to it",1
i it it worries me to turn on the turn on the taps now because_1,1
sounds good.,0
that nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing of,1
uh-huh well that's really interesting,0
yeah even in Washington you know there seems to be lot more women involved,1
wow That's right,0
wow I agree,0
I don’t think that’s how it works another we maybe,1
i can imagine [laughter],0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second decision",1
okay well ta[lk]- talk to you later then bye,1
"In my opinion, that's only partially true",1
okay.,0
I got you.,0
no huh-uh,0
oh [laughter],0
go on.,0
uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that,1
oh.,0
and uh,0
"Wait a second, it happened differently",1
well okay,0
ah.,0
"Sorry but I have a point, that’s not how I see it",1
[noise] and um,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
"In my opinion, we need to pause and think",1
I see.,0
[vocalized-noise] when my fa[mily]- when my family camps we're the the only time you're at,1
we stayed in Galveston Island State Park once but if a storm blew in and,1
indeed Exactly,0
huh Of course,0
well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different,1
hmm Alright,0
definitely Interesting,0
"Let’s not forget, I heard something else",1
sure You bet,0
true Sure,0
yeah it is,0
house that we bought so i'm not doesn't seem like it um i mean i,1
hm.,0
huh Cool,0
wow For sure,0
oh gosh it makes it a little,1
sure Absolutely,0
exactly.,0
"Sorry but I have a point, this doesn't sound right",1
uh right right,0
well i know from some of the sites that we've had done quite a list,1
i think that i think he really his heart was in it but i d[on't]-,1
and um,0
yeah i got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though,1
understood.,0
uh-huh yeah,0
[laughter-yeah] yeah just because they're grandparents jus[t]- yeah just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically,1
yeah well uh,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point maybe",1
well that's understandable yeah that's uh,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing resolve,1
indeed For sure,0
uh yeah,0
wow Sure,0
What if we consider it from another angle think resolve,1
indeed Got it,0
uh-huh.,0
"Sorry to cut you off, there's more to it",1
wow No doubt,0
definitely Right,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
yes.,0
oh yeah,0
understood.,0
and the the lady is very pleased you know she says it's got everything she,1
ah.,0
uh-huh.,0
all right,0
"Wait a second, this part is confusing",1
yeah so that's and that's what ours is our h[ouse]- the house we had before,1
exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your age or,1
and there are about three places in Georgia that does,1
sure I got you,0
uh I see,0
understood.,0
uh-huh.,0
uh but it's uh it's something else yeah tha[t]- they're in the same issue we,1
got it.,0
"I have to interrupt, that's only partially true",1
oh.,0
oh yeah,0
think they're hitting you too hard,1
uh Cool,0
yeah.,0
I don’t think that’s how it works to way to,1
uh Alright,0
[laughter] [laughter-yeah] yeah that's true yeah no i don't uh i don't have i didn't,1
that's really true a lot of it is um,0
yeah well it's it's like so many o[ther]- it's like chicken you know they go,1
from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind,1
if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy,1
invasion of the first type of privacy seems invaded to me in very much everyday,1
totally Of course,0
true I hear you,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this and",1
huh Right,0
yes yes,0
I got you.,0
yes.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly that from",1
and uh,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point because",1
What if we consider it from another angle that another,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this maybe",1
yeah i have a uh,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that another the",1
oh so that's that's how you knew well since like i say we're first time,1
i mean you look at the cars driving down the road and you look at,1
totally Got it,0
uh-huh well see i live in Virginia,0
"I disagree because, you might be mistaken here",1
wow You bet,0
and it was really not not very good uh,1
"I want to add, this doesn't sound right",1
well i don't know wh[at]- how do we end this thing i think it just,1
he's a the movie critic um oh you've oh okay he's a movie critic -[o]n,1
y[ou]- you have to go see that one and how about_1 Silence of the Lambs,1
true Fair enough,0
Got it,0
uh Uh-huh,0
oh i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it it uh,1
yeah glad to see y'all taken care of well the i think what changed everything,1
true Alright then,0
i'm not sure,1
yeah i guess so,0
wow You're right,0
a poodle miniature or uh full size,0
alright.,0
"I have to interrupt, this doesn't sound right",1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
true Got it,0
sure I hear you,0
yes now you know if if every[body]- like in August when everybody's on vacation or,1
okay.,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing should,1
oh i wouldn't doubt it yeah,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly how the",1
uh Cool,0
indeed Fair enough,0
What if we consider it from another angle another resolve,1
oh boy,0
um-hum um-hum um-hum,0
yes i did i was just about to write a letter when i heard they,1
and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we,1
You're right,0
oh.,0
uh first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the,1
yeah yeah,0
and uh,0
that would be great,1
"true, So",0
i thought the story was pretty good too i th[ink]- i think Kevin Costner did,1
indeed I agree,0
how come [vocalized-noise] i've been kind of um,0
What if we consider it from another angle before making,1
no kidding no kidding gosh that's what the the the bugs i don't like the,1
or for that matter you could stop at any stream that looked reasonably clear and,1
"Wait a second, this needs clarification",1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly before to",1
oh [laughter-okay],0
uh-huh.,0
hmm You're right,0
[vocalized-noise] i'm from California [vocalized-noise] my mo[m]- the last time i was like purchased a,1
"Let me jump in, we’ve already discussed that",1
okay uh,0
but i have uh,0
okay and and,1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing before,1
offering a service or,1
"Wait a second, we should consider another option",1
"Let’s not forget, this needs clarification",1
that's uh only way to do it,0
yeah yeah i i hear you [laughter],0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing and,1
"Can I just say, this part is confusing",1
"Oh, Interesting",0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this we",1
well i'm not really aware of those i do know that that our house uh,1
yeah a[nd]- and i mean all it was was a revenue generator,1
wow Oh wow,0
sure yeah yeah i,0
um-hum um-hum,0
cause yeah,0
yes.,0
i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you,1
we've lived in the Richardson area for that you know for the full time uh,1
oh well,0
and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second it",1
oh.,0
we we can't clean it up,1
bye-bye,1
huh No doubt,0
it's suspenseful i don't think it's very t[error]- i mean there's not really any uh,1
you know Texas is known for it's poor schools and that's too bad because_1 we,1
sure.,0
definitely Uh yeah,0
"Hold on, this part is confusing",1
and in inside that U but on one of the corners uh is where that,1
but uh i wouldn't be surprised if that happens within the next few years uh,1
oh.,0
and they s[ay]- s[ay]- -[y]eah it's getting better it's getting better and then you turn,1
yeah yeah,0
yeah i was,0
sounds good.,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing way,1
I don’t think that’s how it works about to how,1
sure That's right,0
What if we consider it from another angle about maybe,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly decision because",1
Okay,0
exactly.,0
oh yeah,0
it's near Austin,1
uh Great,0
oh i see,0
"Actually, this doesn't sound right",1
i don't know this uh,1
I agree.,0
sure.,0
yeah i think so yeah yeah [laughter],0
"Sorry to cut you off, that’s not how I see it",1
go on.,0
yes [laughter],0
yeah [laughter],0
uh True,0
sure So true,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly way because",1
but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought,1
and we're in our second home now we've been in it for uh about thirteen,1
now i agree with their right to um,1
yeah because_1 we have you know,0
wow Alright then,0
hm.,0
right uh-huh,0
oh ye[ah]- yeah,0
yeah no kidding,0
uh-huh.,0
yeah so,0
uh Makes sense,0
exactly.,0
yeah th[at]- that's nice,0
yeah [laughter],0
yep that happens a lot too,0
oh is oh that's great,1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that and about",1
um-hum oh yeah i have to plan way in advance because or what i've done,1
definitely Totally,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly it decision",1
oh.,0
like in Garland they get to choose the schools that they're gonna go to but,1
that's a hard issue to decide uh on the one hand you don't want to,1
which is more intrusive because i have to f[eel]- really tell someone to go away,1
I don’t think that’s how it works it from from,1
wow I see,0
change of location and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so,1
and uh we were i was fortunate in that,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly before should",1
What if we consider it from another angle that from,1
alright.,0
hm.,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that we another",1
right right accessories uh-huh,0
I don’t think that’s how it works from that the,1
oh yeah,0
oh.,0
"Sorry but I have a point, this part is confusing",1
because_1 my our family lives in Missouri and uh when we take trips home we,1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing this,1
oh okay,0
that's helped me a lot with having i can only have a a limited wardrobe,1
ah.,0
oh.,0
it's uh we have thirty two hundred square feet,0
oh yes,0
sure For sure,0
way uh way financing is now if we had a state income tax i'd uh,1
"I disagree because, we should consider another option",1
"Let’s not forget, there's more to it",1
i'm doing fine i'm just uh,0
I see.,0
gotten and uh,0
indeed So true,0
yeah yeah no i- i agree with you there though i mean they want to,1
What if we consider it from another angle resolve think,1
sure I got you,0
"Before you go on, that's only partially true",1
and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of,1
pardon me,1
yeah definitely,0
yeah yeah,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this about",1
yeah so,0
"sure, For",0
oh really,1
totally So true,0
a little more stricter than we do,1
or you hear somebody already starting r[eading]- reading off a list of stuff that they've,1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that the from",1
"Can I just say, there's more to it",1
Sure,0
yeah well [noise],0
ha[ve]- have you been up to that,1
oh that's wonderful,1
has been uh broadcasting,0
exactly.,0
so i I suppose that the housing market is uh you know it is on,1
that's true or the ones that are are generated by a computer it's just a,1
indeed Oh my god,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly resolve the",1
[noise] um-hum,0
indeed You bet,0
um [noise] the other one Silence of the Lambs is kind of a a gory,1
and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there's a,1
hm well what else,1
"That’s not what I meant, we should consider another option",1
oh i see,0
oh how funny,0
uh decided that uh during the campaign she said we weren't gonna have a state,1
y[ou]- you pr[obably]- you probably did less harm than what the water would have done,1
"Before you go on, it happened differently",1
totally Uh yeah,0
things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of,1
[vocalized-noise] Raleigh Durham yeah,0
oh we di[d]- my family when i was younger we went that was just you,1
ah.,0
I see.,0
wow I hear you,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this it",1
I don’t think that’s how it works before making to,1
uh-huh.,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing we,1
yeah huh,0
uh-huh yeah,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
uh Totally,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing resolve,1
uh-huh [noise],0
and uh she's the best uh,0
ah.,0
true Oh my god,0
pretty cl[ose]-,1
but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab,1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second before",1
yes.,0
understood.,0
oh gosh yes uh [noise] oh Yellowstone about four years ago four or five years,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point we",1
okay uh first um i need to know uh h[ow]- how do you feel about,1
i guess part of that is um,0
oh yeah,0
What if we consider it from another angle a to,1
"I want to add, you might be mistaken here",1
i've enjoyed speaking with you,0
yeah they want to see all the horror movies,0
getting down together and doing that and and just the children were involved in the,1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing about,1
hmm I hear you,0
totally I know,0
i don't know if you ever saw that 60 Minutes thing where they showed a,1

[laughter] yeah,0
um-hum oh yeah,0
mhm.,0
yeah sure did,0
have you ever visited it,1
oh you do oh,0
yeah that's true,0
I see.,0
"Actually, I heard something else",1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that it about",1
right.,0
go on.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly and about",1
oh okay,0
oh okay yeah um-hum,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
no it uh it started leaking through the you know out through the pan and,1
but the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman and we're gonna have,1
sure Oh my god,0
got it.,0
mm-hm.,0
"Hold on, it happened differently",1
totally For sure,0
and i uh,0
[noise] i thought we had yeah we just,0
uh there's really a lot isn't [laughter-there] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] there really is,1
"I think it's important to note, that's only partially true",1
definitely I agree,0
I don’t think that’s how it works it to making,1
I see.,0
understood.,0
mhm.,0
indeed Makes sense,0
huh [noise],0
"Let’s not forget, we need a different approach",1
yeah yeah but i'm like you i also um,0
uh I hear you,0
[noise] yeah really,0
yes.,0
I see.,0
and it they got their water from this uh beautiful mountain river,1
uh-huh.,0
hmm For sure,0
alright.,0
exactly.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly think this",1
right right,0
"sense, Makes",0
[noise] right,0
mm-hm.,0
sure Of course,0
deal we were not really happy with the,1
exactly.,0
yeah that's,0
right as a person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then,1
yeah yeah,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that before should",1
hm.,0
[noise] yeah,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point from",1
yep that's [laughter-all] good-bye okay bye,0
right which happens all the time when they go to service the things,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this it",1
yeah.,0
You're right.,0
definitely Of course,0
that's amazing yeah,0
true Totally,0
oh i do too,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
"I want to add, we’ve already discussed that",1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second that",1
yeah.,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly how how",1
"Let’s not forget, that's only partially true",1
so it really doesn't vary that much from season to season since the office is,1
um-hum um-hum,0
what about your casual wear do you like to wear jeans most of the time,1
alright.,0
hello this is Lois,1
yes.,0
yeah where as Puerto Rico is pretty close by,0
we[ll]- isn't isn't Sleeping with the Enemy isn't that a i[s]- is it is it,1
but um [vocalized-noise],0
and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you,1
[noise] and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to,1
it's contaminated,1
"Sorry but I have a point, we need a different approach",1
indeed Interesting,0
oh yeah that's great too,0
[laughter] uh the the other side of that might be uh if if s[omeone]- there's,1
sure Of course,0
i see,0
no i've heard i've heard that's really great though,1
that's right,0
definitely Sure,0
hmm Fair enough,0
wow You're right,0
okay [laughter],0
uh-huh.,0
oh my goodness,0
yeah and,0
um-hum well you must have a relatively clean conscience then [laughter],1
yes exactly,0
it is well both of ours is school age but we don't want to miss,1
well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i- i- i tend,1
i was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in,1
Uh-huh,0
"Can I just say, this needs clarification",1
um on occasion on occasion um i do vary um you know i wear suits,1
the spice yeah,0
"Can I just say, we should consider another option",1
uh For sure,0
[laughter] just exactly,0
oh yeah,0
huh Exactly,0
i've recently um t[ried]- tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that,1
sure For sure,0
nursing home that we finally had fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks,1
yeah similar to that yeah,0
teaching [noise] oh yes,0
uh-huh uh-huh,0
I don’t think that’s how it works to because decision,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
yeah yeah,0
huh I know,0
definitely Alright then,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing think,1
alright.,0
true Exactly,0
mm-hm.,0
i[t]- it was actually powered by a flame,1
Okay yeah,0
mhm.,0
understood.,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that about that",1
sounds good.,0
"right, That's",0
okay sounds good was nice talking to you,1
got it.,0
definitely Okay,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point before",1
totally You bet,0
oh yeah do you think,0
yes.,0
mm-hm.,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that the way",1
oh i see,0
nice talking with you too bye [noise],0
typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second,1
no,1
that's right,0
you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families,1
"I have to interrupt, I heard something else",1
go on.,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
it wasn't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care,1
yeah if um,0
but we can do this tax sheltered annuity that's the only thing that's saving us,1
three or four times yeah,0
it's one of those skorts you know the the it's shorts but it looks like,1
right on,0
"Actually, we need a different approach",1
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second before",1
true Oh wow,0
oh yeah,0
and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for,1
"I want to add, this part is confusing",1
it,1
have you ever tried new vegetables yeah,0
mhm.,0
"Actually, you’re ignoring some facts",1
got it.,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point to",1
go on.,0
totally Fair enough,0
You bet.,0
I don’t think that’s how it works another should a,1
mhm.,0
oh you were oh okay,1
true You bet,0
i think i think we're gonna see a day when s[chools]- uh grade schools are,1
any f[riend]- anyone any friend anyone i give my number to is welcome to call,1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that about that",1
yeah it was pretty bad,0
"Hold on, let me jump in for a second the",1
uh-huh.,0
sure So true,0
so it all depends i mean it depends on where you wind up i guess,1
state tax you can see the logic of it but,1
possibly,1
that occurred to me is there's not so much invasion of my privacy because i,1
definitely Alright then,0
that's right,0
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that a another",1
no they don't they don't ask anything except how old you are i don't think,1
I see.,0
wow Right,0
yeah.,0
yeah that's true that's very true,0
sure Alright,0
hi this is Lisa,1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing think,1
but uh,0
well what do you think are some of the main causes of air pollution,1
yeah who no i don't know who that guy is,1
hmm True,0
yeah right when it was just starting i heard,0
wow True,0
"Sorry to cut you off, this part is confusing",1
uh it's about thirty miles from Sherman,0
and i can't remember what it was,1
true Good point,0
sure.,0
go[sh]- well it's,1
all that kind of stuff uh cooperating with the Canadians on the acid rain problem,1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
definitely I know,0
right right,0
yeah that's what we're doing [noise] so,0
people start paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in,1
sure Got it,0
oh yes yes very much,0
yeah how old,0
"wow, Oh",0
"Actually, we need to pause and think",1
huh Totally,0
"I disagree because, this needs clarification",1
and so any shifting in the foundation of course or or you know i guess,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
hmm I know,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly to making",1
to s[urmise]- to surmise it is there,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly to resolve",1
that's true,1
yeah and s[ome]-,0
got it.,0
"Let’s not forget, that’s not how I see it",1
sure Fair enough,0
got it.,0
mm-hm.,0
definitely Oh wow,0
sure Right,0
sure I know,0
oh uh-huh,0
totally Great,0
right.,0
sure Sure,0
cold w[eather]-,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
right right and does it does it change i guess um you can can you,1
uh TI sent me up on a trip to Wyoming i think it was and,1
yeah tackle and stuff,0
"Let me jump in, there's more to it",1
uh-huh.,0
okay.,0
i think uh,0
wow Cool,0
"Can I just say, we need to pause and think",1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
right.,0
i'm surprised that m[y]- uh my income taxes are as low as they are uh,1
I see.,0
no i haven't,1
yeah hey that's kind of sad,0
oh so you picked a good field then you picked a good field,1
True,0
we just bought our first home after being in school and so we're just first,1
[noise] oh no now see i'd a i'd a never put those two together,1
i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think,1
um-hum um-hum,0
[laughter-oh] i don't know there are better fields to pick,1
you know socioeconomic areas homes and it's just like they always have money they they,1
totally.,0
"Actually, this part is confusing",1
alright.,0
sounds good.,0
go on.,0
okay.,0
sounds good.,0
alright.,0
uh rollback the taxes on everybody's houses and everybody would save,1
ah.,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
hmm So true,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point this",1
yeah but i think uh you know i think so far as uh as the,1
indeed Sounds good,0
totally That's right,0
i think they ought to teach people how to shoot them_1 too how to take,1
uh other times it could be very casual if you knew you would be at,1
we had a lot of fun,1
okay.,0
I don’t think that’s how it works that another and,1
uh pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you,1
definitely Cool,0
huh Sounds good,0
with all the uh sulfur and all that other stuff they're dumping out into the,1
What if we consider it from another angle another another,1
we were scared to buy a an house,1
pick up my daughter but anyway it was uh i[t]- the it it's interesting though,1
I see.,0
huh Sure,0
definitely For sure,0
"I have to interrupt, we’ve already discussed that",1
definitely Alright,0
I got you.,0
let me see,1
totally Yeah,0
[noise] right,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly about we",1
yeah the reason i asked is because,0
uh-huh.,0
uh-huh.,0
so this storm really i[t's]- uh it's been incredible,0
sounds good.,0
is that right,0
got it.,0
oh i know i know,0
yeah.,0
sure I agree,0
right.,0
because_1 anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a,1
hmm I got you,0
true True,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this to",1
"I think it's important to note, we’ve already discussed that",1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that how we",1
and and it's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go,1
I don’t think that’s how it works resolve resolve maybe,1
"Wait a second, there's more to it",1
lots of people yeah yeah,0
mhm.,0
there's hope i actually for all for the time i've spent there i still don't,1
ah.,0
"Wait a second, this doesn't sound right",1
indeed That's right,0
"Actually, we’re missing the key part",1
and um i called you know from that the the TI Database Calling Instructions,1
as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere,1
I got you.,0
I see.,0
that uh,0
indeed I got you,0
um-hum you're a student,0
okay.,0
wow Makes sense,0
that's right i[t]-,1
"Let me jump in, this part is confusing",1
you know,0
yes uh-huh,0
no huh-uh,0
"I think it's important to note, there's more to it",1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point because",1
ice storms of course you know we all came in in our tennis shoes but,1
oh i know i wish i'd app[reciated]- i wish i'd appreciated it more y[ou]- uh,1
I see.,0
hmm Uh yeah,0
yeah well that's that's,0
indeed Totally,0
alright.,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
totally.,0
[vocalized-noise],1
understood.,0
"Wait a second, that’s not how I see it",1
um obviously everyday,1
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing decision,1
oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of,1
"Sorry but I have a point, you might be mistaken here",1
huh Got it,0
totally Sounds good,0
yeah yeah yeah that's true that's true,0
definitely Uh-huh,0
huh Sure,0
sure.,0
pardon me,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this we",1
indeed Of course,0
totally Makes sense,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point we",1
of course,0
so i think that's real nice too to come up with different options do you,1
sounds good.,0
which is totally legal but the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually shave,1
oh yeah there's that's a weakness there that's just,0
uh i think we just hang up yeah okay [laughter] thanks bye [laughter] [noise],1
oh yeah that's it,0
wow Right,0
as a matter of fact i did,1
indeed Uh yeah,0
oh.,0
I don’t think that’s how it works to it this,1
oh yes,0
understood.,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point the",1
oh.,0
oh.,0
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this we",1
they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything,1
but uh,0
well that makes sense,1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that decision another",1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
i think there's still some discrimination there where as you know men and wor[k]- women,1
now could be that we could do the same thing that they're doing out in,1
right.,0
"That’s not what I meant, this doesn't sound right",1
yeah the only,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point this",1
huh Totally,0
um-hum um-hum,0
yeah yeah yeah,0
what i would love to see done to stop all of this,1
mhm.,0
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
hm.,0
um-hum um-hum,0
definitely That's right,0
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
yeah [noise],0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly way that",1
so and i like that because_1 you can find out the good schools in your,1
true Exactly,0
but uh,0
"yeah, Uh",0
oh okay i well li[ke]-,1
"know, I",0
indeed For sure,0
"That’s not what I meant, this part is confusing",1
oh that yeah fine kind of tired,0
uh-huh yeah t[ell]- t[ell]- tell me about it i just got rid of a a,1
i see,0
"Actually, that's only partially true",1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
May I interrupt for a moment to respond to that,1
go on.,0
uh Alright then,0
definitely I know,0
yeah so,0
definitely True,0
yes.,0
Let me interrupt you there and clarify one thing resolve,1
you know if uh,0
exactly.,0
What if we consider it from another angle maybe because,1
oh yeah sure realistically it is yes,0
uh I see,0
indeed Right,0
yeah i i couldn't i couldn't bear to think about eating a chicken after seeing,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly to how",1
because it was uh so much cheaper than gas now you look diesel's,1
it's interesting i don't know i can't imagine i guess that's why we're going in,1
definitely Fair enough,0
"Let me jump in, we’re missing the key part",1
sounds good.,0
yeah yeah,0
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point because",1
yes yeah yes,0
"In my opinion, that’s not how I see it",1
I don’t think that’s how it works another think before,1
um-hum bye,0
I don’t think that’s how it works a way another,1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that because to",1
exactly exactly,0
hmm Sounds good,0
mm-hm.,0
got it.,0
mhm.,0
yeah well that's very true [laughter] but,0
"Just a second, can I add something quickly how how",1
I think what you're saying is not entirely correct because,1
I got you,0
mm-hm.,0
hi um yeah i'd like to talk about how you dress for work and and,1
true No doubt,0
yeah that is a problem,0
oh th[at]- that would be,1
oh it's still just a pup,0
[vocalized-noise] yeah,0
sure Cool,0
I don’t think that’s how it works another before from,1
exactly.,0
got it.,0
ah.,0
she was very well aware and her daughter came and visited her at least her,1
"Sorry, but I have to disagree with that point making",1
have you ever been camping in any of the big national parks,1
so i was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the,1
"Just a second, can I add something quickly the a",1
understood.,0
totally I see,0
"Can I just say, we’ve already discussed that",1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that and think",1
in our neighborhood because all of the homes did have these foundation problems and we,1
that's my opinion on it [laughter] so what now,1
"Let’s not forget, we should consider another option",1
me i'm in the legal department and um we do have uh a group of,1
I don’t think that’s how it works decision before about,1
[laughter-yeah] compared to what we're having,0
hmm Great,0
causing acid rain and everything else,1
uh I got you,0
that uh was a real good one to [laughter-do],0
indeed Sounds good,0
so [noise] did it look cracked to you i mean that's how you knew it,1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this resolve",1
"Wait, I just thought of something related to this this",1
so what about your income tax,1
"Let me jump in, we need a different approach",1
"Actually, I have a different opinion on that because the",1
right.,0
totally Interesting,0
sounds good.,0
but then usually in the summer it's cold in the offices because_1 the air conditioner's,1
[laughter-that's] [laughter-right],0
got it.,0
yeah yes that is,0
oh yeah oh those are,0
hmm Sounds good,0
