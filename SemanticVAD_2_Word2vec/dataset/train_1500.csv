text,labels
well i should probably get,1
looked like antlers i don't,1
i'm just wondering about the,1
sure Alright,0
things that invade that second,1
that's true or the ones,1
well i mostly listen to,1
uh what you call that,1
i do i go every,1
you know we need if,1
Let me interrupt you there,1
uh permits you know for,1
uh-huh.,0
[laughter-do] [laughter-you] believe that,1
and uh we can't deep,1
yeah ours were ours were,1
uh No doubt,0
oh.,0
she is she's the most,1
and so,1
even had some of them_1,1
yeah yeah it really was,1
[noise] i mean i think,1
oh well th[ey]- they had,1
from what i've heard that,1
Sorry but I have a,1
exactly exactly right,0
like in Garland they get,1
it's nice you can wear,1
yeah i mea[n]- you know,1
i mean,1
uh-huh that sounds interesting we've,1
now i agree with their,1
"Let me jump in, we",1
oh really,1
yeah it's uh having uh,1
doesn't sound like a lot,1
uh Alright,0
hi this is Lisa,1
so i I suppose that,1
they bring in half a,1
yeah even in Washington you,1
"Just a second, can I",1
rap,1
"Let’s not forget, we’ve already",1
"Hold on, let me jump",1
well considering the national budget,1
okay bye-bye,1
you know perhaps if we,1
so i i- predominantly wear,1
that's true and and i,1
[laughter] i don't have that,1
exactly.,0
uh i see what you mean so that,0
she had a fall and,1
ozone yeah ozo[ne]- ozone pollution,1
the Sherman facility we are,1
and because_1 our house payment,1
bubbling nicely you know the,1
yeah i know that's that's,1
we can't even well we're,1
you know [noise] and then,1
whether it won all kinds,1
i'm really particular about the,1
and people would leave me,1
all right,0
totally You're right,0
definitely Sounds good,0
finds out information about you,1
it had to be done,1
i think there's still some,1
the money that we used,1
typical thing that happens uh,1
oh okay,0
naw i can believe it,1
is that right well,1
oh yeah,0
but it wasn't too long,1
it wasn't necessarily you know,1
well that's good well that's,1
oh absolutely,0
we we don't we we,1
that's true,1
yeah pretty bad but we,1
yeah but uh i'm i,1
oh no i think yeah,1
that that is true i,1
me i'm in the legal,1
air pollution,1
all that kind of stuff,1
[vocalized-noise],1
[laughter] oh i mean you,1
and he was a real,1
he he [laughter-plays] on Murphy,1
yeah they might be or,1
you know uh now that,1
oh okay so it still,1
i don't know liquefy right,1
um let's see what did,1
as a as a westerner,1
you kn[ow]- [laughter] and i,1
no they did away with,1
oh yeah,0
yeah it's i[t's]- y[ou]- it's,1
Texas and uh,0
but still i work in,1
and they did aw[ay]- w[ent]-,1
"I disagree because, this doesn't",1
"Actually, this needs clarification",1
so on next night i,1
we had an existing IRA,1
comes yeah,0
yeah i got a call,1
a new solution we have,1
cold w[eather]-,1
possibly,1
but uh she has the,1
oh.,0
but the ozone i mean,1
"Sorry, but I have to",1
wonder if there'd be some,1
uh i would say about,1
[laughter] yeah,0
i think that's just pretty,1
i i like music that,1
uh twenty dollars a year,1
yeah a[nd]- and i mean,1
but we can do this,1
oh me neither me neither,1
um i- i- i think,1
yeah i've never had any uh,0
[noise] this is pretty uns[easonal]-,1
peddling products if i wanted,1
[laughter] yeah Marge i don't,1
right that's about what they,1
yes he's,1
yeah well it's it's like,1
but the new idea is,1
but but no concept for,1
that's helped me a lot,1
wow Of course,0
yep that's exactly right,0
um-hum is it is it,1
exactly.,0
um no i think n[ow]-,1
uh-huh.,0
that's about that as far,1
so i think that's real,1
some of them are crazy,1
i can see that there,1
how's that,1
no that's true,1
go on.,0
are economically disadvantaged won't have,1
um [noise] the other one,1
he's Eldon her housepainter,1
[laughter-that's] that's true so um,1
yeah i don't know it,1
what what our uh goals,1
because the the system is,1
terrain,1
exactly or the way you,1
yeah yeah i i think,1
May I interrupt for a,1
lots and lots of people,1
oh she weighs in at,1
and invariably just about the,1
uh that uh scrub out,1
i've often wondered now this,1
"Let’s not forget, we need",1
and and it's their mission,1
for the national budget and,1
you know we may need,1
and and and i guess,1
i was personally acquainted with,1
yeah but i think uh,1
uh you had and uh,1
true Alright,0
um-hum um-hum,0
but it's really a big,1
i've enjoy[ed]- exactly i've enjoyed,1
[noise] and so that that,1
oh i can't either not,1
"I want to add, I",1
"Hold on, we need a",1
and so any shifting in,1
we don't need anymore,1
have you seen Dancing with,1
"Can I just say, it",1
[noise] call again,1
uh but they still come,1
sure.,0
because_1 uh when i was,1
[noise] well that pretty much,1
[laughter] so i'm not sure,1
and i develop a nice,1
Let me interrupt you there,1
y[ou]- you have to go,1
now is that place built,1
air pollution,1
uh potentially that's supposed to,1
yeah i i couldn't i,1
if privacy is something that,1
but we're not funding them_1,1
fourteen years that's pretty good,1
i[t]- it wasn't serving the,1
where am i calling,1
well Randy we've just about,1
"Can I just say, that’s",1
not just merely had a,1
that really uh,0
yeah i think a great,1
oh i have to open,1
but that was a design,1
wow I see,0
because_1 my our family lives,1
if if the child is,1
i guess we've discussed everything,1
y[eah]- yeah but there's really,1
and uh we are presently,1
bec[ause]- right because you don't,1
um and seaso[n]- really same,1
i- i don't kn[ow]- i,1
to catch this Freon as,1
Lewisville okay i'm in Garland,1
they he had to fill,1
oh that's the best way,1
most states have it i,1
wow I know,0
"it, Got",0
oh so that's that's how,1
exactly.,0
well they're already talking about,1
that i just thought were,1
i guess we've discussed everything,1
[laughter] yeah,0
well now course in California,1
i've camped in a in,1
way uh way financing is,1
yeah well i don't have,1
and uh it's usually not,1
you know Texas is known,1
i've often wondered about the,1
um i'm surprised it's,1
got it.,0
burning and everything else,1
about_1 catching some disease,1
because_1 women are in every,1
it,1
and a lot of my,1
y[eah]- yeah we just say,1
"I have to interrupt, we",1
pardon me,1
"Sorry, but I have to",1
get that cash advance uh-huh,0
causing acid rain and everything,1
indeed Great,0
couldn't take her with me,1
well that's great,1
any bad stuff so uh,1
it's near Austin,1
well the first thing for,1
and i have not discovered,1
I think what you're saying,1
"Sorry to cut you off,",1
uh you had to have,1
it's slab,1
that's true,1
yes yes you'd b[e]- more,1
come home and get back,1
entertainment and then our our,1
what do you think about,1
that'd be culturally [laughter-shocking],1
hm yeah yeah,0
you know,0
I think it's important to,1
it seems it seems to,1
i was really into the,1
it's suspenseful i don't think,1
nursing home that we finally,1
it really is uh the,1
whatever we've got coming in,1
and i just have a,1
that's those are my words,1
um-hum yes oh it is,0
and so what we go,1
do you,1
in our neighborhood because all,1
there's this invisible barrier around,1
service stations are going to,1
um it uh [vocalized-noise] you,1
not really i think i,1
the forms that have really,1
with all the uh sulfur,1
yeah where i you know,1
um-hum oh yeah i have,1
uh i'm familiar with that one,0
yes it's a heck of,1
totally.,0
like a John Lee Hooker,1
I don’t think that’s how,1
that's about it i guess,1
I got you.,0
the people that were doing,1
yeah but i can remem[ber]-,1
[laughter] instead of stop,1
and it's it's such a,1
pardon me,1
all right are you ready,1
and um you you listen,1
as you know the they're,1
what else,1
you get started on them,1
and um that was pretty,1
but adults if they're strange,1
huh I hear you,0
a harassment in itself,1
uh-huh what's her name by,1
yeah it is oh well,1
that'd be culturally [laughter-shocking],1
I think it's important to,1
and um that was pretty,1
you too bye,1
well of course it's you,1
i believe we've pretty much,1
i've never even bought a,1
Let me interrupt you there,1
it uh definitely responds to,1
huh Alright then,0
yeah i think what we,1
"That’s not what I meant,",1
yes that's uh real easy,1
no they did away with,1
have you seen Sleeping with,1
"Just a second, can I",1
i think that's the problem,1
oh i do too,1
hi Archie i'm Sharon,1
and they've really um well,1
i mean when i was,1
[noise] i know i i,1
alright.,0
sure.,0
wow Totally,0
but i'm not in that,1
oh that sounds interesting,1
uh and i had been,1
three years to ten years,1
i think a law should,1
but if they're going to,1
[noise] i do too especially,1
mm-hm.,0
well i was i was,1
yeah that's true living in,1
that's the other financial thing,1
um-hum well now here's another,1
yes i did i was,1
uh-huh.,0
well i uh appreciate that,1
I see.,0
let's say another audience let's,1
she has the the color,1
yeah well my uh my,1
i'm a mathematician,1
yes and yet even at,1
y[eah]- and then the cover,1
which means there's a higher,1
huh I agree,0
so can you dress pretty,1
yeah i had a friend,1
he anyway he it's interesting,1
uh but it's uh it's,1
but sh[e]- uh she is,1
pick up my daughter but,1
well about a year i,1
a little more stricter than,1
well i guess although,1
expenditures because_1 it can get,1
thi[s]- one that you raised,1
I know,0
okay yes,0
especially where they've had uh,1
yeah i've seen that that's,1
when i go camping i,1
it's uh part Chow and,1
that's true i agree with,1
"Just a second, can I",1
and he does uh he,1
i know when my mother,1
my mother excuse me go,1
par[t]-,1
um i've visited the Wyoming,1
that sounds real good,1
i never did like diesels,1
"Actually, I have a different",1
they are they trying to,1
and it was really not,1
um-hum i also hm thought,1
you know full cash price,1
i[t]- it was actually powered,1
I think it's important to,1
no you must really keep,1
well my dog's an outdoor,1
uh they used to do,1
May I interrupt for a,1
and they should give every,1
ten or twelve years old,1
but on the other hand,1
yeah yeah,0
"Hold on, let me jump",1
What if we consider it,1
[laughter] [laughter-i-] [laughter-know] [laughter-i] know,1
to catch this Freon as,1
-[o]kay well it's been nice,1
hmm I see,0
actually no um,1
yeah there's a lot of,1
hm.,0
[noise] oh no now see,1
as far as you know,1
no,1
and i spread the newspapers,1
yeah that's uh i always,1
uh Okay,0
yeah so that's and that's,1
and she was the one,1
some of them are crazy,1
or for that matter you,1
responsibilities like that seem to,1
the qua[lity]- but actually have,1
I think what you're saying,1
okay so um yes we,1
because_1 anyone can be alone,1
well presumably those who find,1
mhm.,0
but then when i went,1
you talked about the telephone,1
it's one of those skorts,1
and a lot of my,1
yeah i,0
"Actually, I have a different",1
yeah the only thing we,1
uh on the scale they,1
but i consider invasion of,1
typically feeling invaded in my,1
so i tend to get,1
my mother also was very,1
uh the induction ports and,1
[laughter] uh the the other,1
go[sh]- well it's,1
and then i would feel,1
yeah but uh well our,1
she was very well aware,1
I got you.,0
yeah it's uh having uh,1
um-hum hum,0
but then usually in the,1
no,1
"In my opinion, you might",1
and i don't know i,1
uh she's still trying to,1
oh well that's good,0
oh okay i well li[ke]-,1
let me see,1
totally Right,0
so that i can keep,1
yeah the one g[ood]- nice,1
and then gave us a,1
that's true,1
we camped at the let's,1
i'm on my turf if,1
"Sorry, but I have to",1
yeah that,0
you know you don't feel,1
yeah small PCs aren't they're out of Korea right,0
What if we consider it,1
ten or twelve years old,1
uh there's really a lot,1
a little piece of trivia,1
be it electrical as in,1
i read somewhere that the,1
and uh i don't know,1
"Hold on, let me jump",1
so it really doesn't vary,1
oh that's good,1
well i guess without a,1
yeah.,0
mm-hm.,0
well a mutt myself i,1
but not so not in,1
oh th[at]- that would be,1
uh Washington DC um-hum,0
yeah well children aren't easily,1
i i th[ink]- i think,1
[noise] Han[cock]- oh [noise] John,1
true Right,0
"Wait, I just thought of",1
that's great,1
he wanted to direct it,1
um it takes some it,1
no shoes socks shirts or,1
"Let’s not forget, this doesn't",1
sure absolutely and people are,1
service stations are going to,1
sell the house and move,1
hello,1
oh we di[d]- my family,1
[noise] and um gosh it,1
do you work like half,1
ooh no [laughter] no,1
yeah so well it uh,1
you know you you always,1
uh i think that they,1
now could be that we,1
hello this is Lois,1
uh well i was i,1
and they have sold a,1
well maybe not quite a,1
but uh you know that's,1
sounds good.,0
mm-hm.,0
yeah well i i don't,1
i mean that's a real,1
so [noise] we don't have,1
indeed True,0
what uh what do you,1
you know i don't know,1
yeah yeah,0
oh.,0
that's true and and i,1
May I interrupt for a,1
yeah i have have gun,1
inherent politeness on the phone,1
"Wait, I just thought of",1
yes he's,1
oh yeah that's neat,0
jeez well that's scary,1
[laughter] some people do i,1
"Wait, I just thought of",1
and so w[hat]- w[hat]- you,1
the way people are being,1
okay and and,1
i'm drawing the blank,1
and they did aw[ay]- w[ent]-,1
any of the grandparents [laughter-would],1
change of location and it,1
who,1
uh-huh uh-huh,0
right yeah [laughter-exactly] you cannot,1
you were very fortunate,1
spending summers at my grandfather's,1
oh he does,1
that's great,1
hmm Absolutely,0
where they where they make,1
i['ll]- i'll see that you,1
that is that one that,1
nope that's about all for,1
i- i don't kn[ow]- i,1
virtually anyone any hacker being,1
Let me interrupt you there,1
one thing and if privacy,1
closer to but still have,1
which is more intrusive because,1
mhm.,0
it's uh some kind of,1
true Cool,0
paid them his royalties every,1
May I interrupt for a,1
very,1
and so w[hat]- w[hat]- you,1
little bit,1
well basically what happens is,1
as a matter of fact,1
"Wait, I just thought of",1
and is,1
[laughter] yeah [noise],0
i can't talk about the,1
i don't know,1
um-hum oh yeah it's just,1
Let me interrupt you there,1
"Just a second, can I",1
oh yeah,0
uh-huh.,0
definitely Good point,0
but uh i checked into,1
"Actually, we should consider another",1
wow No doubt,0
have you ever lived in,1
when it becomes militant or,1
typical thing that happens uh,1
yeah somebody in South Carolina,1
so what about your income,1
they they've um you know,1
and after i signed in,1
oh.,0
wow Good point,0
hmm Absolutely,0
oh i'm not exactly sure,1
i'm surprised that m[y]- uh,1
yeah i imagine it's really competitive,0
I agree,0
give you know the original,1
totally Got it,0
where you do know about,1
no it didn't,1
yeah there there was one,1
indeed Sure,0
what was called talking blues,1
oh i do i really,1
huh I agree,0
{alrighty} uh i guess our,1
-[i]t's kind of an easy,1
um i think you have,1
um if your defining it,1
and uh i just drove,1
hundreds of [laughter-thousands] [laughter-of] [laughter-people],1
as a recurring character every,1
are you,1
but then for the last,1
uh you know just like,1
that's a good choice we've,1
i don't know liquefy right,1
pretty cl[ose]-,1
uh rollback the taxes on,1
wow Absolutely,0
how do you feel about,1
this has been an interesting,1
mainly because he's a football,1
well what do you find,1
wow Fair enough,0
uh-huh yeah t[ell]- t[ell]- tell,1
now the part about where,1
mhm.,0
well the interesting thing was,1
um uh usually engineers are,1
than just delegate it i,1
you kn[ow]- [laughter] and i,1
oh.,0
uh other times it could,1
right.,0
and i can't remember what,1
yeah yeah i i i,1
uh yeah currently,0
course i'm,1
yeah i i i think,1
but i guess that's it,1
huh Interesting,0
that's the only way that,1
sure Right,0
y[ou]- you pr[obably]- you probably,1
oh is oh that's great,1
um-hum well you must have,1
Sorry but I have a,1
neither have i,1
do you do you listen,1
uh-huh exactly not what color,1
yeah right and uh,0
not really i think i,1
even had some of them_1,1
Fair enough,0
yeah glad to see y'all,1
what about your casual wear,1
burglar alarm going,1
oh yeah,0
and wanting to uh you,1
have you ever been camping,1
wow So true,0
wow I know,0
and you tell me that,1
yeah well they're um you,1
in the mid and early,1
sure Good point,0
so can you dress pretty,1
heard a lot about Richardson,1
indeed Oh wow,0
so that's real helpful so,1
i think that i think,1
uh how do you feel,1
oh yes,0
well the next morning i,1
and they i know they,1
[disea[l]-/diesel] uh diesel engine that,1
i tell you funny thing,1
um special thing buying land,1
oh okay,0
and um i called you,1
oh no,1
and for n[othing]- uh for,1
no kidding no kidding gosh,1
"Actually, I have a different",1
oh my gosh,0
hmm Good point,0
well i know from some,1
um i guess i'm not,1
and Miles Davis worked with,1
that was the big one,1
sure Totally,0
and and uh that that,1
like the bumper sticker [laughter],1
oh i can't either not,1
"Sorry, but I have to",1
"Before you go on, that’s",1
"Actually, I have a different",1
no matter how strange they,1
"Sorry, but I have to",1
um-hum i also hm thought,1
um i[n]- matter of fact,1
that occurred to me is,1
okay um well i've lived,1
you know that that it,1
right that's just a matter,1
so just distribute it equally,1
[noise] yeah they didn't uh survive the freeze,0
[laughter] lost a lot of,1
totally Good point,0
as in uh martini,1
"Wait, I just thought of",1
sure.,0
i see right,0
yeah that's all i have to say thank you,0
uh however i d[o]- i,1
absolutely un[fortunately]- unfortunately at a,1
really you know,0
most definitely,1
and i don't know too,1
but we um,1
no they don't they don't,1
i mean you look at,1
yeah i guess there was,1
you don't have to go,1
you know it it very,1
what do you mean by,1
right which happens all the,1
i i think i agree,1
yeah [noise] the other thing,1
well you too and uh [noise],0
you too bye,1
uh pretty close to it,1
a harassment in itself,1
"then, Alright",0
[noise] not formally,1
yeah is is fairly fami[liar]-,1
go on.,0
nice talking to you too,1
any f[riend]- anyone any friend,1
right right and does it,1
yeah there's [laughter] yeah but,1
hope they're telling you [laughter],0
we have a another loan,1
understood.,0
oh no no [laughter] i've,1
that would be great,1
i it it worries me,1
my mother excuse me go,1
pipe system or water system,1
sounds good.,0
yeah yeah [laughter-the] yeah that's,1
sure Makes sense,0
right right,0
i don't know that i,1
okay well,1
mean you can see that,1
and you're gonna think well,1
but you know i don't,1
and as far as i'm,1
yeah but we[ll]- well you,1
oh well uh is it,1
i have some friends that,1
and then plus then you,1
pursue their religion of choice,1
you know with the beard,1
okay well ta[lk]- talk to,1
they their attire is always,1
take care now bye,1
ha[ve]- have you been up,1
invasion of the first type,1
"Just a second, can I",1
uh well actually you know,1
[laughter-yeah] yeah just because they're,1
and they s[ay]- s[ay]- -[y]eah,1
you know take everything out,1
he said now we do,1
i can take that for,1
uh well,0
I see.,0
uh y[eah]- yeah you know,1
i guess down here uh,1
because uh apparently the foundation,1
uh-huh.,0
and a lot of their,1
ah what a shame,1
because it was uh so,1
what one forty one fifty,1
[noise] well that pretty much,1
uh which is a matter,1
the uh the Beatles and,1
and um i mean but,1
oh no i can remember,1
whereas in this country where,1
oh so you picked a,1
that's great,1
What if we consider it,1
that was even harder actually,1
"I want to add, it",1
i don't know how long,1
to s[urmise]- to surmise it,1
"Sorry, but I have to",1
oh it's been nice talking,1
What if we consider it,1
totally.,0
yeah and it was usually,1
right as a person who,1
deal we were not really,1
yeah what uh,0
and uh sounds th[e]- sounds,1
w[ell]- well did you ever,1
uh quite honestly i i,1
and there were some pretty,1
it still only in time,1
than just delegate it i,1
[noise] it's,1
"Hold on, we’re missing the",1
wow Oh wow,0
okay hi,1
sure True,0
okay what now uh what,1
uh Good point,0
hmm Alright,0
running from one stake to,1
but they're they're trying to,1
and once they get the,1
so well uh,0
but speaking of cars [noise],1
definitely Exactly,0
a running total,1
i see,0
"Sorry to cut you off,",1
it's interesting i don't know,1
i've recently um t[ried]- tried,1
uh I hear you,0
there's hope i actually for,1
they're introducing some new product,1
and i mean they've always,1
i thought the story was,1
maybe we'll get together again,1
go on.,0
and invariably just about the,1
"Actually, I have a different",1
okay sounds good was nice,1
it with the,1
definitely Oh my god,0
yeah.,0
but uh my family used,1
right it turned out to,1
have you ever got one,1
uh You're right,0
we've always got a got,1
but mostly in Texas on,1
right yeah y[ou]- you know,1
and there were some pretty,1
"Wait, I just thought of",1
uh that uh scrub out,1
do you know who the,1
as a matter of fact,1
understood.,0
i mean there's uh a,1
i think the only way,1
indeed Right,0
uh i think we just,1
Let me interrupt you there,1
[laughter-well] um,0
hello,1
[laughter] and the like a,1
yeah yeah,0
you know socioeconomic areas homes,1
so and i like that,1
go on.,0
federal tax is okay,1
mhm.,0
but but no concept for,1
[laughter] yeah you just sort,1
well it's it's not really,1
no it didn't,1
you can only laugh [laughter],1
well i um run a,1
because the the system is,1
yeah a lot of times you can do that,0
commercial soli[citations]- solicitations primarily,1
and then basically since then,1
yeah they'll just i do,1
i i'm more worried about,1
"Hold on, let me jump",1
uh No doubt,0
so i tend to get,1
and although they were it,1
you know is there something,1
true Makes sense,0
yeah i think it's getting,1
yeah well i don't have,1
okay uh first um i,1
yes oh i do too,1
pluses and minuses because_1 uh,1
huh Oh wow,0
you know what i feel,1
um so there's not i,1
unless it's an ex[tremely]- you,1
what i would love to,1
i can't think,1
right right is there is,1
my gosh it's okay for,1
i'm on my turf if,1
i mean i i it,1
he wanted to direct it,1
they they do copy versions,1
mm-hm.,0
"Just a second, can I",1
um-hum yeah,0
i i remember seeing the,1
i know at least in,1
well i work in uh,1
so just distribute it equally,1
uh the question is did,1
[laughter] we finally got a,1
oh goodness okay is our,1
yeah well children aren't easily,1
uh we've we've uh taken,1
so [noise] did it look,1
[laughter-oh] i don't know there,1
we had a lot of,1
i can take that for,1
the Sherman facility we are,1
uh well for like on,1
"Sorry, but I have to",1
I think what you're saying,1
what do you think about,1
I think what you're saying,1
no i haven't,1
i don't know what it,1
but then for the last,1
so my immediate reaction was,1
mm-hm.,0
house that we bought so,1
oh i do too much,1
to accommodate the motion detectors,1
it was it was just,1
one of these people that,1
ozone,1
[laughter-so] [laughter-i],0
uh-huh.,0
and from West Africa that's,1
"Actually, I have a different",1
did you,1
normally when they call you're,1
wow Got it,0
and i think Louisiana does,1
uh you know i think,1
and yet they haven't done,1
i saw an article in,1
i think that i think,1
well i lived in Omaha,1
most definitely,1
we're just getting more than,1
i mean when i was,1
uh on the scale they,1
yeah [laughter] i don't know,1
may[be]- maybe it wasn't that,1
we really like our school,1
so it all depends i,1
i put a stop to,1
um i don't know music,1
i don't have a sense,1
[noise] yes pretty much i'm,1
huh You're right,0
hmm Interesting,0
it just turned two i,1
mm-hm.,0
no i've heard i've heard,1
oh i do too much,1
as well as what society,1
plus i bet it cuts,1
that's right um-hum,0
and they have sold a,1
and uh it's usually not,1
bye-bye,1
i don't care [laughter],0
hi Cynthia what did you,1
"Hold on, we need to",1
i think that's the problem,1
yeah it Jimi Hendrix was,1
well that makes sense,1
yes yes,1
What if we consider it,1
it's contaminated,1
and uh fortunately we agreed,1
i was in high school,1
I don’t think that’s how,1
[laughter] well you know he was uh,0
[vocalized-noise] i'm from California [vocalized-noise],1
[laughter] oh i believe that,1
yeah yeah no i- i,1
we camped at the let's,1
[laughter] yeah Marge i don't,1
well we uh when we,1
i well that's a good,1
yes i know because_1,1
did you,1
Lewisville okay i'm in Garland,1
Sorry but I have a,1
and uh i live in,1
"Oh, You're right",0
[noise] and um gosh it,1
yes now you know if,1
the way people are being,1
yeah.,0
oh no i think yeah,1
oh [laughter-jeez],0
oh gosh it makes it,1
no i haven't been camping,1
pardon me,1
that's true,1
yeah they might be or,1
that's right but just because,1
he's a the movie critic,1
so that's another example of,1
go on.,0
yeah you really it seems,1
actually it's Gin Two,1
um i took a boat,1
so i was very comfortable,1
the action over the rocks,1
in the process of expanding,1
wow yeah,0
hopefully the next generation it,1
oh [laughter],0
i'd like to be able,1
you know is there something,1
my fiance and i one,1
but she's big enough to,1
exactly and that's um when,1
or a lot of women,1
had fell and needed to,1
bye-bye,1
"Wait, I just thought of",1
"Oh, I know",0

"In my opinion, I heard",1
that's,1

yeah [laughter],0
finding a place and everybody,1
[laughter-oh] really,1
What if we consider it,1
i don't even know how,1

i think we're gonna s[ee]-,1
uh probably seven or eight,1
Sorry but I have a,1
"Sorry to cut you off,",1
"Sorry, but I have to",1
indeed Makes sense,0
oh that's interesting,1
and uh fortunately we agreed,1
I think it's important to,1
i think they ought to,1
we have coming in each,1
"Sorry, but I have to",1
oh that's good,1
not much,1
May I interrupt for a,1
yeah i i i think,1

and i guess that turns,1
getting down together and doing,1
yeah you know it's it's,1
[vocalized-noise] when my fa[mily]- when,1
because i'm usually so insulted,1
but uh i do make,1
definitely Of course,0
and they just find places,1
May I interrupt for a,1
i know but i remember,1
most states have it i,1
Let me interrupt you there,1
yeah exactly right it really,1
and you're trying to crawl,1

"Wait, I just thought of",1
offering a service or,1
evens it out as far,1
oh how awful,1
yeah there there was one,1
oh okay i'm not that,1
May I interrupt for a,1
um-hum that'd be tough,1
i agree with you on,1
yeah so you know i,1
that everyone should have the,1
yeah well then you know about that wind,0
yeah mostly what we're doing,1
uh-huh um you know there's,1
that's right i[t]-,1
and they've really um well,1
i realize that that i,1
"Actually, we’ve already discussed that",1

well i um i i,1
and makes it more uh,1
when it was really just starting yeah,0
and you know they're not,1
and see there's no secrecy,1
nice talking to you too,1
good and yourself,1
"Just a second, can I",1
I don’t think that’s how,1
listen to it all the,1
the men often have to,1
now i wish i could,1
and therefore you won't be,1
i guess that's most of,1
well it was nice talking,1
so it it it it's,1
well i guess without a,1
I think what you're saying,1
I see,0
and there are about three,1
yeah you know it's it's,1

[noise] and i really hate,1
and we prepare a lot,1
okay.,0
sure I agree,0
oh i don't know CIA,1
true Makes sense,0
I think what you're saying,1
incorrect things that's even worse,1
um-hum wh[ich]- which seems so awful,0
then all of a sudden,1
pinks and greens yeah,0
neither have i,1
you know it's just you,1
yeah well my uh my,1
a little piece of trivia,1
May I interrupt for a,1
Let me interrupt you there,1
hm well what else,1
he's a very good arranger,1
uh to a certain level,1
huh Makes sense,0
right.,0
well world music is um,1
oh gosh,0
um-hum he was very goo[d]-,1
oh that's that's neat how,1
well i'm beginning to wonder,1
and a lot of their,1
is it,1
i have some friends that,1
i think it was the,1
uh TI sent me up,1
uh you had to have,1
uh yes,0
we've lived in the Richardson,1
well what do you think,1
i think your right,1
what everything would hinge upon,1
totally I got you,0
uh Tom Jones our environmental,1
and i understand now uh,1
I don’t think that’s how,1
and uh we can't deep,1
we stayed in Galveston Island,1
i've often wondered now this,1
you know and then we,1
and take it easy now,1
or uh,0
i don't know this uh,1
no kidding it really is,1
i think i think we're,1
well um i wouldn't uh,1
what i look like what,1
which just keeps accumulating [noise],1
not much,1
um if your defining it,1
right uh is yours a,1
uh they used to do,1
"Before you go on, we",1
and so when you start,1
uh-huh.,0
certainly it would seem to,1
indeed Oh my god,0
that's the only way that,1
a with a certain style,1
seven percent or something it,1
[laughter] jeez [laughter],1
oh that's wonderful,1
so yeah i do i,1
you know the law now,1
yeah i've seen that that's,1
it's just you know judging,1
things that invade that second,1
i,1
yeah i had uh i,1
quite a quite a world,1
right yeah because_1 we don't,1
[noise] people that are uh,1
i've never even bought a,1
uh decided that uh during,1
i'm not sure,1
hi um yeah i'd like,1
but uh were going to,1
"Actually, that’s not how I",1
does your work entitle uh,1
okay um well i've lived,1
wow Okay,0
"Oh, I see",0
mm-hm.,0
looked like antlers i don't,1
[laughter-do] [laughter-you] believe that,1
they're voice activated and you've,1
they think it's ridiculous to,1
well the class[ic]- the other,1
and they tried flushing it,1
hm.,0
huh uh-huh,0
well i don't know wh[at]-,1
but uh i wouldn't be,1
so you know well a,1
um on occasion on occasion,1
uh-huh yeah,0
uh which is a matter,1
totally.,0
indeed Uh yeah,0
and uh they used the,1
i remember i saw him,1
uh-huh.,0
and then,1
What if we consider it,1
you know perhaps if we,1
go on.,0
that's good to be in,1
have you done a lot,1
totally Interesting,0
yeah was it,0
yeah who no i don't,1
really good piece of work,1
totally.,0
uh well like one week,1
so my immediate reaction was,1
yeah i[s]- there is a,1
and i think that's what,1
that he,1
[noise] i know i i,1
"That’s not what I meant,",1
but didn't they pass that,1
mm-hm.,0
oh that that's a remarkable,1
dress shorts,1
i'd be very very careful,1
uh-huh oh as long term,1
[laughter] shaking the scorpions out,1
have you seen Dancing with,1
i think that i think,1
Wild Thing do you remember,1
because i mean there are,1
no it uh it started,1
uh first thing we always,1
from from personal parties or,1
but uh next morning she,1
I don’t think that’s how,1
and uh the dog i,1
yes.,0
fourteen years that's pretty good,1
yes and yet even at,1
about_1 catching some disease,1
yeah real scruffy looking and,1
okay all right hey bye-bye,1
well right they destroyed it,1
true I agree,0
um true,0
well it's been nice talking,1
you know uh that way,1
because_1 i wouldn't want to,1
uh well actually you know,1
we were scared to buy,1
that would be an example,1
well i'm not really aware,1
well i um run a,1
well they i guess w[e]-,1
uh the question is did,1
well that's good,1
yes.,0
yes.,0
definitely Makes sense,0
that's my opinion on it,1
sure Sounds good,0
uh Got it,0
uh this is air side,1
i think your right,1
come home and get back,1
Let me interrupt you there,1
yeah right,0
oh i know i wish,1
the cream of the crop,1
money seems to be too,1
that nursing home life would,1
definitely No doubt,0
but i realized i have,1
and since then uh i've,1
you live in Virginia now,1
that is nice,1
well it's been nice talking,1
i let's see,1
very,1
which is totally legal but,1
true No doubt,0
May I interrupt for a,1
were very interested that to,1
that's a hard issue to,1
I got you.,0
and i thought yeah that,1
pluses and minuses because_1 uh,1
uh she'd rather sl[eep]- sleep,1
i'm not really into this,1
to be out of debt,1
oh it's it's real easy,1
people start paying attention to,1
no the first time i,1
totally Right,0
what do you think about,1
I see.,0
wow Got it,0
oh i do too just,1
i think it was the,1
could be i- i haven't,1
and sh[e]- you know we,1

sounds good.,0
and right from day one,1
we just bought our first,1
