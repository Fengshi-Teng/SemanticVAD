you know self uh,0
but uh,0
yeah exactly,0
but uh,0
yeah i agree with that,0
yeah it's,0
yeah,0
yeah that is a problem,0
but it's uh,0
yeah yeah,0
yeah he's he's about my favorite,0
yeah tackle and stuff,0
yeah i've noticed they they're now,0
oh yeah,0
uh-huh yeah,0
yeah uh-huh,0
yeah what uh,0
yeah so so are you a,0
yeah that's,0
right on,0
um yeah,0
and uh,0
yeah right,0
yeah,0
yeah huh,0
oh i see,0
but um,0
but um,0
oh okay,0
hi um yeah i'd like to talk about how you dress for work and and,1
and is,1
right right is there is there um an- is there a like a code of,1
right right and does it does it change i guess um you can can you,1
yeah and it was usually uh also uh where i was it was um i-,1
um uh usually engineers are expected to to dress you know little more professionally it,1
uh other times it could be very casual if you knew you would be at,1
uh well i was i was in a uh private consulting firm so um and,1
um and seaso- really same season to season um uh it changes with the weather,1
that's,1
that's true and and i think also that um the women actually have uh uh,1
the men often have to wear shirt and    r- right right what,1
that's true so um do they were were there um are you allowed to,1
okay and and,1
yeah ours were ours were different i guess it seemed like th- they were much,1
yeah  i don't know what el- what more we can say about that that's,1
oh it's been nice talking to you and i guess we just hang up huh,1
okay hi,1
well i work in uh corporate control so we have to dress kind of nice,1
we can't even well we're not even really supposed to wear jeans very often,1
so it really doesn't vary that much from season to season since the office is,1
not formally,1
but it's kind of understood that we're supposed to dress a little bit nice a,1
and we prepare a lot of foils for Marvin and Bill so  we have,1
yes now you know if if every- like in August when everybody's on vacation or,1
ice storms of course you know we all came in in our tennis shoes but,1
unless it's an ex- you know an unusual day,1
it with the,1
but then usually in the summer it's cold in the offices because_1 the air conditioner's,1
it,1
not really i think i mean it's kind of unwritten but i think we're supposed,1
but i'm not in that professional of a position  so i don't i'm not,1
yes pretty much i'm a secretary  yeah,1
y- yeah but there's really no written rule i guess they couldn't write that down,1
it's just you know judging from what everyone else wears is how i determine,1
you know what i feel a comfortable in you don't wanna stand out too much,1
well that pretty much covers    well thanks for calling me,1
okay uh first um i need to know uh h- how do you feel about,1
she had a fall and uh finally uh she had uh Parkinson's Disease and it,1
that was even harder actually because it was you know it was just a change,1
change of location and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so,1
and um that was pretty heartrending for her i think when she finally came to,1
not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything,1
yeah well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions i think that,1
than just delegate it i think that they they had a great deal of um,1
getting down together and doing that and and just the children were involved in the,1
finding a place and everybody had duties to perform you know whether it was just,1
and they i know they and well they had well they had they had seen,1
she was very well aware and her daughter came and visited her at least her,1
and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest,1
um i- i- i think it would be it was more of a relief for,1
and um i mean but she was truly she was truly aware i mean i,1
i i th- i think that what one thing that w- that they were really,1
it wasn't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care,1
were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible i,1
what everything would hinge upon is it how close is it to a home environment,1
yeah you know it's it's interesting that that a lot of the population in the,1
you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families,1
um i- matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families,1
we we don't we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because,1
yeah yeah i i i think that perhaps perhaps the extended family,1
you know that that it may be one of the solutions to a lot of,1
any of the grandparents          they're gonna,1
yeah but uh i'm i i think that you know i mean we always uh,1
especially where they've had uh extended family and i and an- i i kind of,1
you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and,1
money seems to be too big of an issue wi- with with with with with,1
you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may,1
the qua- but actually have a truer standard of living,1
okay well,1
okay all right hey bye-bye,1
well of course it's you know it's it one of the last few things in,1
i'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out uh our had,1
and uh we were i was fortunate in that,1
i was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in,1
so i was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the,1
had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore,1
it had to be done in a hurry i mean we didn't have you know,1
and it was really not not very good uh,1
deal we were not really happy with the,1
nursing home that we finally had fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks,1
but it's really a big uh big decision as to you know when to do,1
you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out,1
my mother excuse me go ahead,1
that's great,1
that's right i-,1
you were very fortunate,1
absolutely un- unfortunately at a lot of times it,1
responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole,1
and uh it's usually not a very smooth smooth thing we were uh l-,1
and uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should,1
my mother also was very very independent she had her own still had her own,1
we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke,1
that nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing of,1
that's great,1
um-hum that'd be tough,1
yeah i think a great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the,1
sure absolutely and people are families are scattered so much nowadays,1
yeah just because they're grandparents jus- yeah just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically,1
right that's just a matter of defining priorities i guess or some priorities anyway,1
i think your right,1
me i'm in the legal department and um we do have uh a group of,1
and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for,1
a new solution we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and,1
but the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman and we're gonna have,1
from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind,1
uh permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to,1
now is that place built or you're still in the makings of it,1
well i know from some of the sites that we've had done quite a list,1
you know the law now is a super fund and anybody who's contributed toxic waste,1
uh everybody has to contribute and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've,1
you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other,1
certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the Sherman facility than um,1
it still only in time starts to leak out,1
yeah there there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place,1
jeez,1
oh you were oh okay,1
yes it's a heck of a lot different i mean w- we used to be,1
we finally got a little respect nobody thought of us as a profit center,1
you too bye,1
{alrighty} uh i guess our topic today is air pollution and we are to just,1
as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere,1
does your work entitle uh anything in environmental along these lines,1
very,1
yeah it's uh having uh uh w- well i work in too i work in,1
lost a lot of hair over that project uh what we run into um,1
and a lot of their rules and regulations aren't real clear so we have our,1
and uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow,1
uh this is air side a- allow to have certain emissions up to a certain,1
and so w- w- you know what we do to make contributions so that basically,1
uh that uh scrub out the NOX and uh VOCs and and the ammonia compounds,1
uh to a certain level we are very um uh aware of the opacity which,1
and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there's a,1
as you know the they're allowed to come on site the {federaldes} anytime they want,1
the Sherman facility we are still in the,1
closer to but still have a little bit of um finalization to do right it's,1
uh Tom Jones our environmental corporate environmental guy's handling the project,1
uh but it's uh it's something else yeah tha- they're in the same issue we,1
because the the system is setup where it won't have any emissions uh you're correct,1
any bad stuff so uh i think TI we spend o- o- of all the,1
uh first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the,1
possibly,1
we have hoods we have ductwork and all those type of uh interesting pieces of,1
and uh we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid and,1
but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab,1
which is totally legal but the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually shave,1
expenditures because_1 it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do,1
this has been an interesting topic uh i was one of the i was responsible,1
yeah glad to see y'all taken care of well the i think what changed everything,1
exactly and that's um when you start m- when you start paying your wages you,1
i've enjoy- exactly i've enjoyed speaking with you see you later bye-bye,1
well i guess without a doubt we'd have to say automobiles although i suppose manufacturing,1
uh y- yeah you know i'm wondering uh course uh Freon is uh is uh,1
uh what you call that layer there ozone layer,1
i wonder when they're gonna what they'll be able to use in pro- in place,1
uh well actually you know that is the way a refrigerator works,1
well basically what happens is you have to have some form of heat,1
be it electrical as in your home refrigerator or propane as the one on the,1
uh you had and uh somehow cr- heat must be created that Freon,1
oh i'm not exactly sure what happens but apparently it expands in the heat and,1
in the process of expanding it goes through cooler coils and whatnot and it becomes,1
w- well did you ever see what happens when they uh replace the or replenish,1
i mean there's uh a lot of it is uh turned out into the atmosphere,1
and i understand now uh i don't know if it's international or just here in,1
service stations are going to require to have a special device,1
to catch this Freon as it is ex- expelled the excess Freon,1
and therefore you won't be able to just pull in anywhere to or you wouldn't,1
no that's true,1
spending summers at my grandfather's place and i'd be running around with nothing but a,1
no shoes socks shirts or anything,1
uh i mean from dawn till dusk,1
and i develop a nice tan but uh my gosh it never had to worry,1
or for that matter you could stop at any stream that looked reasonably clear and,1
about_1 catching some disease,1
i tell you funny thing happened to me with with polluted water,1
uh TI sent me up on a trip to Wyoming i think it was and,1
town kind of backwoods town you know uh where big night on the town is,1
but uh i checked into a motel,1
and after i signed in and everything why the uh clerk told me uh don't,1
it's contaminated,1
he said now we do have bottled water we supply to our guests but unfortunately,1
i- i'll see that you get a bottle of it,1
well the next morning i got up the water had not been delivered yet and,1
oh well th- they had this uh,1
it's uh some kind of a bacteria call- or carried by animals,1
and it they got their water from this uh beautiful mountain river,1
well maybe not quite a river but a little bigger than a stream,1
but this uh bacteria had uh penetrated their entire,1
pipe system or water system,1
and they tried flushing it out they they couldn't get rid of it,1
i've often wondered now this is years ago and i've often wondered what they ever,1
bubbling nicely you know the which uh is what purifies water when it bubbles,1
yes and yet even at that it was still contaminated,1
well i'm beginning to wonder too i mean you g- you're always hearing stories about,1
then all of a sudden you turn around and,1
my gosh it's okay for to doing it this way but if you turn around,1
as a matter of fact i did,1
neither have i,1
i've often wondered about the LA now that's supposed to be about the worst c-,1
air pollution,1
uh they used to do it down in Florida now i lived down there for,1
no they did away with it because they found out that uh,1
the people that were doing it it was just a racket to them,1
and for n- uh for nothing  too,1
um-hum well now here's another thing diesels,1
and yet they haven't done a thing to them,1
uh-huh yeah t- t- tell me about it i just got rid of a a,1
well i um i i had good luck with mine until it finally just blew,1
is that right well,1
as a matter of fact it may have been Buick i think because_1 i think,1
-/diesel] uh diesel engine that was converted from a gas engine,1
and uh they used the same pistons and and cylinders and whatnot but all they,1
uh the induction ports and and etcetera etcetera whatever needed to be changed over,1
and although they were it seemed practical at the time they were nothing but a,1
and they did aw- w- t- we- finally did away with them_1 and went to,1
well now course in California they're they have much stricter codes than we have elsewhere,1
now could be that we could do the same thing that they're doing out in,1
i don't know what it is precisely but uh they're doing they do something,1
a little more stricter than we do,1
well what do you think are some of the main causes of air pollution,1
yeah i i i think cars are probably one of the biggest offenders but then,1
with all the uh sulfur and all that other stuff they're dumping out into the,1
causing acid rain and everything else,1
ozone yeah ozo- ozone pollution yeah,1
well i was i was thinking  that too i mean uh we don't have,1
but on the other hand you know i i've,1
um i took a boat cruise one time and it had a refrigerator on board,1
i- it was actually powered by a flame,1
oh okay so it still had Freon in it,1
oh okay i well li-,1
right which happens all the time when they go to service the things,1
i i'm more worried about the ozone than i am anything else i i i,1
all that kind of stuff uh cooperating with the Canadians on the acid rain problem,1
but the ozone i mean you know we can't replace that,1
we we can't clean it up,1
burning and everything else,1
i- i don't kn- i don't know what the rain forests have to do with,1
and i just have a feeling that that you know that's our s- that's our,1
i don't know this uh,1
ozone,1
naw i can believe it,1
y- you pr- you probably did less harm than what the water would have done,1
go- well it's,1
the action over the rocks and all that kind of stuff,1
jeez well that's scary,1
i it it worries me to turn on the turn on the taps now because_1,1
you kn-  and i and i don- i don't really trust these these government,1
yeah well it's it's like so many o- it's like chicken you know they go,1
i don't know if you ever saw that 60 Minutes thing where they showed a,1
yeah i i couldn't i couldn't bear to think about eating a chicken after seeing,1
right that's about what they say about the the air pollution in this country,1
and they s- s- -eah it's getting better it's getting better and then you turn,1
i don't know,1
uh you had to have your car checked for pollution every year you had to,1
and there are about three places in Georgia that does,1
and i think Louisiana does i'm not sure but i there's not very many of,1
i think that's the problem with most of it the politicians finally did away with,1
yeah a- and i mean all it was was a revenue generator,1
i- it wasn't serving the purpose that it was designed to serve,1
i mean you look at the cars driving down the road and you look at,1
and you tell me that guy passed a pollution,1
yeah i mea- you know what was it back in the uh late seventies when,1
because it was uh so much cheaper than gas now you look diesel's,1
what one forty one fifty a gallon while gas is o- you know one oh,1
i never did like diesels anyway they they were too cantankerous,1
cold w-,1
yeah i had a friend of mine had a uh had a Buick had had,1
i don't know liquefy right and then his injector things got clogged and oh Go-,1
but speaking of cars  what more can we do to cars to make them_1,1
i'm just wondering about the feasibility of electric cars,1
i saw an article in the pap-,1
hi Cynthia what did you wear to work today,1
so can you dress pretty casually,1
well i um run a business out of my home,1
so i tend to get up in the morning put on sweats um do whatever,1
come home and get back into regular clothes,1
i've recently um t- tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that,1
that's helped me a lot with having i can only have a a limited wardrobe,1
what about your casual wear do you like to wear jeans most of the time,1
it's nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when it's so,1
dress shorts,1
not much,1
i guess down here uh we just recently moved to Texas so my wardrobe has,1
you live in Virginia now oh that's interesting,1
i'd like to be able to wear those here today it's eighty eight degrees so,1
this is pretty uns- unseasonal but um at least we you know it it,1
okay sounds good was nice talking to you,1
bye-bye,1
um let's see what did i wear to work today um actually i wore corduroy,1
um on occasion on occasion um i do vary um you know i wear suits,1
uh-huh um you know there's real no no no real dress code where i work,1
so i i- predominantly wear flat shoes um you know in the winter i wear,1
yeah well they're um you know they're like Ber- yeah they're like black corduroy Ber-,1
they their attire is always the same you know suits or slacks you know jeans,1
it's one of those skorts you know the the it's shorts but it looks like,1
yeah yeah so i'm you know like right now today was in about you know,1
i guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing  okay okay it was nice,1
have you done a lot of camping recently,1
oh okay i'm not that much familiar with Texas we've been my family has been,1
but mostly in Texas on the way to   we've had oh gosh we've,1
i've camped in a in   a back of a v- van then we,1
oh gosh yes uh  oh Yellowstone about four years ago four or five years,1
oh we di- my family when i was younger we went that was just you,1
we had a lot of fun,1
oh no no  i've done it but it's not fun  you don't want,1
ooh no  no,1
shaking the scorpions out of their shoes,1
oh me neither me neither th- the -squitoes just keep you up all night,1
when my fa- when my family camps we're the the only time you're at,1
we camped at the let's see we camped down at at Galveston two or three,1
and the and the smell of that was kind of gross but,1
oh how awful,1
oh that's miserable,1
yeah it's i- y- it's y- you always when you when there's kids you've always,1
oh i know i wish i'd app- i wish i'd appreciated it more y- uh,1
now i wish i could go back to those  yeah the time and i've,1
that's true,1
so it it it it's a it can be really handy to have a camper,1
because_1 my our family lives in Missouri and uh when we take trips home we,1
that's nice you know paying five or six dollars instead of forty,1
what else,1
i think that's just pretty much it we've been on here awhile,1
well it's been nice talking to you,1
bye-bye,1
no i haven't been camping since i was about sixteen,1
but uh my family used to have a pop-up trailer and we'd go camping to,1
it's near Austin,1
have you ever been camping in any of the big national parks,1
when i go camping i don't i don't like to rough it i like to,1
i'm not really into this going and sitting in a tent for a few days,1
God,1
i have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer they're,1
and they just find places to camp and go looking for rocks and,1
doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me uh my friend said that the,1
no kidding no kidding gosh that's what the the the bugs i don't like the,1
yeah the one g- nice thing i remember about camping with my parents is they,1
we stayed in Galveston Island State Park once but if a storm blew in and,1
and there were some pretty big dunes before the the camping area and the sand,1
yeah pretty bad but we had a good time in our camper we usua- we,1
yeah well children aren't easily entertained by just enjoying the nature,1
oh gosh it makes it a little,1
my fiance and i one day would like to own a big motor home,1
mainly because he's a football he's a college football coach and we're gonna have to,1
and it'd be nice if we had a big ole motor home and that way,1
that is nice,1
no kidding it really is,1
nice talking to you too bye,1
this is Archie,1
have you seen Dancing with Wolf,1
have you ever lived in that part of the country,1
have you ever visited it,1
i think it was the Black Hills of South Dakota,1
well i lived in Omaha for five winters and that rolling kind of uh,1
yeah is is fairly fami- the thing that i thought was interesting was that the,1
uh and i had been told you know you wouldn't notice that it was three,1
well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i- i- i tend,1
and and and i guess that's what i really like although i must admit i,1
no i've heard i've heard that's really great though,1
no you must really keep up,1
we- isn't isn't Sleeping with the Enemy isn't that a i- is it is it,1
do you do you listen to Gary Cohill Cohi- is uh you know who he,1
he's a the movie critic um oh you've oh okay he's a movie critic -n,1
and he does uh he has a talk show on the,1
KLIF anyway it's on from seven to nine or something and and and people call,1
ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies but it's,1
he anyway he it's interesting you listen to him and then you you go watch,1
pick up my daughter but anyway it was uh i- the it it's interesting though,1
uh the question is did he did he really know it was gonna be good,1
do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon,1
a little piece of trivia you know the guy when he first headed out from,1
he he  on Murphy Brown,1
yes he's,1
he's Eldon her housepainter,1
believe that,1
that's  that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you,1
you know with the beard and all that stuff i mean it's uh,1
yeah real scruffy looking and it wa- it was really funny it's uh that that,1
i don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we're at about,1
well i don't know wh- how do we end this thing i think it just,1
don't we do that good-bye Sharon,1
hi Archie i'm Sharon,1
yeah i've seen that that's uh that was a really good movie probably one of,1
i thought the story was pretty good too i th- i think Kevin Costner did,1
no i haven't,1
um i've visited the Wyoming area i'm not sure exactly where Dances with Wolves was,1
could be i- i haven't been to South Dakota,1
ha- have you been up to that,1
terrain,1
that's true i agree with that um i- i noticed yesterday in the paper something,1
did you,1
have you seen Sleeping with the Enemy,1
y- you have to go see that one and how about_1 Silence of the Lambs,1
i do i go every  i- i uh those are two definite must see,1
it's suspenseful i don't think it's very t- i mean there's not really any uh,1
um  the other one Silence of the Lambs is kind of a a gory,1
yeah somebody in South Carolina told me about him,1
i think that i think he really his heart was in it but i d-,1
he wanted to direct it he wanted to a- to star in it you know,1
whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the,1
i think that i think he did a good job and and the self-satisfaction he,1
yeah who no i don't know who that guy is,1
oh he does,1
as a recurring character every week,1
oh no now see i'd a i'd a never put those two together,1
you think so i mean i haven't been watching my watch um,1
well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different,1
if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy,1
one thing and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts,1
invasion of the first type of privacy seems invaded to me in very much everyday,1
finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh,1
um obviously everyday,1
right it turned out to be uh uh an invitation,1
from from personal parties or from these uh phone answer- phone uh commercial things,1
oh that that's a remarkable number i get them rarely and i'm still astounded that,1
because i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i,1
i think they prey on people's um,1
inherent politeness on the phone even with a machine i find people being kind of,1
well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would,1
oh i don't know CIA conspiracy theories or whatever would have uh such parties trying,1
things that invade that second type of privacy,1
where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of,1
i can't talk about the second one other than to to to generate paranoia,1
um-hum well you must have a relatively clean conscience then,1
yes yes you'd b- more harmed or something yeah,1
yes i did i was just about to write a letter when i heard they,1
yeah and i one of the problems with the Lotus database was uh that it,1
uh you know just like software is only given out to customers i mean you,1
you know full cash price for it i mean you know you can't tell what,1
virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending,1
and that hacker just has to get into in touch with a sneak thief and,1
um-hum i also hm thought about it because_1 i was uh waiting to talk to,1
that occurred to me is there's not so much invasion of my privacy because i,1
but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not,1
i realize that that i mean,1
i can take that for granted but i used to i used to live in,1
things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of,1
um so there's not i mean doors don't have latches on them people don't tend,1
as a as a westerner in India i was often surprised and felt my sense,1
you know it it very much is but on the other hand i realized i,1
and people would leave me alone,1
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go,1
people start paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in,1
but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of,1
and which isn't al- always the case in all cultures and it wasn't until i,1
and they've really um well i mean i i wonder how people have sex and,1
there's hope i actually for all for the time i've spent there i still don't,1
because_1 anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a,1
there's this invisible barrier around me which people will re- will respect and if that's,1
well the class- the other classic examples the Jehovah's Witness or or Mormons or someone,1
which is more intrusive because i have to f- really tell someone to go away,1
what i look like what i live like and norm- and they're doing something that,1
any f- anyone any friend anyone i give my number to is welcome to call,1
i i think i agree with that i think in a good example on the,1
typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang and it's TI calling my immediate,1
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that i,1
uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that,1
commercial soli- solicitations primarily,1
and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems,1
and and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for,1
um i guess i'm not,1
typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second,1
thi- one that you raised and i don't think i would have thought about that,1
to s- to surmise it is there,1
well i guess although,1
i well that's a good point where you said that how does one define what,1
um if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you,1
i don't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things i'm,1
uh the the other side of that might be uh if if s- there's,1
bec- right because you don't have anyway to turn it off the- did you hear,1
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i,1
and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained,1
incorrect things that's even worse uh or if my call rate of of eight t-,1
right as a person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then,1
and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of,1
oh that's interesting,1
but but no concept for wanting to be private,1
oh th- that would be,1
that'd be culturally,1
that that is true i hadn't thought about that and and that is fascinating to,1
that's interesting are th- are there any other specific things that that you feel like,1
so that's another example of the invasion because of a nonsol-,1
good and yourself,1
pardon me,1
i'm in Lewisville,1
little bit,1
that's a hard issue to decide uh on the one hand you don't want to,1
uh rollback the taxes on everybody's houses and everybody would save,1
uh twenty dollars a year or whatever but it would cut back twenty million dollars,1
and as far as i'm concerned you know hey twenty bucks a year is not,1
you know Texas is known for it's poor schools and that's too bad because_1 we,1
pardon me,1
that's true,1
yeah i know that's that's only part of the problem,1
i think we're gonna s-,1
are you,1
i think were gonna see a day come,1
i think i think we're gonna see a day when s- uh grade schools are,1
you know uh that way old people don't have to have have money going to,1
but uh i wouldn't be surprised if that happens within the next few years uh,1
i don't know that i think has,1
pluses and minuses because_1 uh those that,1
are economically disadvantaged won't have the ability to make a  the choice will be,1
i think the only way they're gonna really get to the problem and solve it,1
that's the only way that i can see it's gonna be resolved is there are,1
and they should give every teacher a a hundred percent raise  tha-  that's,1
i mean when i was in college i did a lot of teaching uh for,1
i'm a mathematician,1
pardon me,1
i don't know there are better fields to pick,1
i mean,1
yeah where i you know kind of stuff i do i i use my education,1
so it all depends i mean it depends on where you wind up i guess,1
the way people are being laid off right and left it's all a matter of,1
but uh ba- back to the taxes though i mean uh it's a difficult issue,1
i can see that there might be a reason for one but i would hate,1
most states have it i know and i've lived in states that have had it,1
way uh way financing is now if we had a state income tax i'd uh,1
which just matter of we'll see what happens i'd rather have that i guess than,1
no it didn't,1
which means there's a higher probability of now having a state income tax even though,1
uh decided that uh during the campaign she said we weren't gonna have a state,1
actually no um,1
i'm surprised that m- uh my income taxes are as low as they are uh,1
uh which is a matter of uh,1
um i'm surprised it's,1
well considering the national budget i think George Bush wanted one point four trillion dollars,1
for the national budget and for a family of four like what i got that,1
and you're gonna think well wait now  where's the other eighteen thousand dollars or,1
it's interesting i don't know i can't imagine i guess that's why we're going in,1
they bring in half a trillion dollars and they spend one point four and then,1
that's about it i guess,1
seven percent or something it depends on where you're at some places in Dallas i,1
how's that,1
that's the way to do it,1
no,1
and so when you start taking talking taking more out of your paycheck to go,1
yeah i think what we n- what uh the government the state government needs to,1
because_1 when they got all this fraud and waste going on they need to just,1
uh well for like on the welfare system if they gave all that money directly,1
and you know they're not making that much money they're making probably more like five,1
yeah well i don't have that  a lot of times if i've got a,1
quite a quite a world we live in,1
Arch how are you doing tonight,1
where am i calling,1
where are you,1
Lewisville okay i'm in Garland um have you read anything about how they propose to,1
what do you think about it equalization of funding,1
but we're not funding them_1 like other states either though you know it we're not,1
that's right but just because we've got a lot of money doesn't mean that's gonna,1
i mean i think there's a lot of waste in in schools i'm a,1
well they're already talking about freedom of choice you know for schools that's an idea,1
that's true,1
but like in Garland  you can choose the school that you're going to,1
like in Garland they get to choose the schools that they're gonna go to but,1
so and i like that because_1 you can find out the good schools in your,1
so just distribute it equally and not raise taxes,1
oh so you picked a good field then you picked a good field,1
what do you think about a state income tax,1
but didn't they pass that thing that we were gonna have a lottery or not,1
so what about your income tax,1
think they're hitting you too hard,1
which just keeps accumulating  i don't know  what else do you think about,1
and the city tax the sale tax they used to you really didn't even think,1
i don't even know how they figure it really i'm glad i don't work in,1
because_1 i wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess,1
so it wouldn't be so bad  all right so you think,1
federal tax is okay,1
state tax you can see the logic of it but,1
you don't think it would be economically feasible for your family and ours see both,1
we don't need anymore,1
but we can do this tax sheltered annuity that's the only thing that's saving us,1
par-,1
lots and lots of people before they get it,1
but still i work in southeast Dallas,1
and a lot of my children are from poor,1
you know socioeconomic areas homes and it's just like they always have money they they,1
and i mean they've always got dessert money or they've always got you know dollars,1
you know it's just you see garbage pans i mean pails just filled and we,1
and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs,1
that he,1
yeah it is oh well is that you got anything else to say i don't,1
okay well ta- talk to you later then bye,1
uh on the scale they gave one to ten i'd say i'm probably a four,1
i'm not totally i'm not,1
one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns,1
that everyone should have the right to have a hand gun in their house if,1
no they don't they don't ask anything except how old you are i don't think,1
yeah they might be or you know how we are here in Texas it's,1
i've never even bought a gun myself my dad's given it to me or someone's,1
it really is uh the only problem i have with gun control is that they,1
yeah exactly right it really is because they're gonna get them_1 one way or another,1
and they're illegal  i don't think it would do us any good to outlaw,1
that's true,1
i think they ought to teach people how to shoot them_1 too how to take,1
right yeah  you cannot take the gun home until you've taken this course sign,1
oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it all the i've worked with,1
they think it's ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course,1
looked like antlers i don't know,1
but i guess that's it,1
that's my opinion on it  so what now,1
uh i think we just hang up yeah okay  thanks bye,1
uh how do you feel about gun control,1
some people do i,1
yeah there's a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy,1
i'm from California  my mo- the last time i was like purchased a,1
they he had to fill out some forms but i guess California might be tougher,1
it's,1
like the bumper sticker  it's true yeah,1
people that are uh criminals are the ones that are gonna get them_1 and,1
yeah i have have gun g- have have gun management 101,1
God gun control  it's it's such a heated topic in the the and people,1
some of them are crazy too  whew yeah yeah they go out there and,1
yeah Marge i don't know what happened to your husband he just never came,1
i'm not sure,1
i let's see,1
y- yeah we just say good-bye and hang up okay  okay thanks bye-bye,1
have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or,1
offering a service or,1
they're introducing some new product in the area and,1
normally when they call you're either in the shower or you in the middle of,1
that was the big one i'm talking about i work weird hours,1
and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the,1
and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone,1
or you hear somebody already starting r- reading off a list of stuff that they've,1
even had some of them_1 the,1
they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything,1
what i would love to see done to stop all of this,1
we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted,1
i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think,1
but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought,1
that's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences,1
i put a stop to some of them_1 as far as the door-to-door either religious,1
peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to,1
now i agree with their right to um,1
pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think,1
i'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them_1 otherwise i,1
now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says,1
i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver,1
wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get,1
but i consider invasion of my privacy,1
a harassment in itself,1
i believe we've pretty much summed everything up,1
i'm drawing the blank,1
uh pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you,1
and take it easy now good night,1
that is that one that you were talking about,1
that's true or the ones that are are generated by a computer it's just a,1
um-hum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of,1
so yeah i do i really feel that that's uh an invasion of my privacy,1
i agree with you on that particular subject there,1
let me see,1
yeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you,1
uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk,1
and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to,1
and um gosh it was about_1 nine o'clock at night too it wasn't even,1
and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly,1
yeah yeah no i- i agree with you there though i mean they want to,1
and and it's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go,1
and i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at,1
and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you,1
yeah that's true yeah no i don't uh i don't have i didn't,1
but you know i don't think that that would stop people i mean it's like,1
instead of stop,1
hm well what else,1
i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you,1
you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door,1
and i can't remember what it was,1
and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we,1
oh goodness okay is our five minutes up,1
pretty cl-,1
well it was nice talking to you too Jim,1
okay thanks bye,1
okay um well i've lived in the in the Dallas and Richardson area for about,1
and we're in our second home now we've been in it for uh about thirteen,1
we've lived in the Richardson area for that you know for the full time uh,1
well it's it's not really all that bad uh i think you live in Plano,1
i know i i think that there's some areas in you know in uh,1
so i'm not sure what the prices are like now uh i know that,1
but then for the last several years it's pretty well stabilized uh and perhaps even,1
but uh we've done uh you know in order to maintain ours we've done some,1
uh but uh i guess i'm i'm a little encouraged with home prices i i'm,1
and they have sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one you know,1
and the the lady is very pleased you know she says it's got everything she,1
so i I suppose that the housing market is uh you know it is on,1
well i'm not really aware of those i do know that that our house uh,1
because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that,1
but that was a design problem because we put uh and we designed the house,1
and in inside that U but on one of the corners uh is where that,1
and so any shifting in the foundation of course or or you know i guess,1
and of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of uh of metal,1
no it uh it started leaking through the you know out through the pan and,1
yeah but i think uh you know i think so far as uh as the,1
yeah but uh well our house and i'm not sure how all of the b-,1
and once they get the foundation poured then they they apply tension to that iron,1
and makes it more uh s- more stable and and puts more strength into it,1
uh potentially that's supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the,1
right uh is yours a is it a a slab foundation or pier and beam,1
yeah so that's and that's what ours is our h- the house we had before,1
and uh i just drove by there this morning and it still looks just as,1
yeah so you know i think houses uh i think they hold up pretty well,1
yeah so well it uh you know i think it's a a good place to,1
okay thank you you too,1
we just bought our first home after being in school and so we're just first,1
oh so y- you're an old pro then,1
well what do you find having to be like out there i've always heard that,1
oh really,1
well we uh when we graduated from school in Houston uh my husband w- went,1
heard a lot about Richardson being a good area and the homes there being really,1
well that makes sense,1
oh that's good,1
well do you have a lot of homes out there that have um foundation problems,1
so  did it look cracked to you i mean that's how you knew it,1
oh so that's that's how you knew well since like i say we're first time,1
we really like our school out here,1
but we um,1
we were scared to buy a an house,1
in our neighborhood because all of the homes did have these foundation problems and we,1
well that's good well that's really good well our house is older it's like a,1
house that we bought so i'm not doesn't seem like it um i mean i,1
it's slab,1
well that's good,1
yes my grandfather was a builder and so my parents always lived in houses that,1
well i uh appreciate that information about Richardson i know it was um it's got,1
fourteen years that's pretty good well thank you and well um you g- good luck,1
hello this is Lois,1
and um i called you know from that the the TI Database Calling Instructions,1
uh there's really a lot isn't    there really is,1
oh i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it it uh,1
all right are you ready now okay like i said i guess it would be,1
um no i think n- now you go to work when they're six weeks old,1
oh i do too much and it's just gonna get better it really is,1
oh i can't either not a one,1
yeah even in Washington you know there seems to be lot more women involved,1
yes yes,1
oh i do too just your qualifications and that would be it,1
yeah i kind of think maybe in time that you know you'll go by social,1
yeah they'll just i do too just go by your social security number and then,1
and if you get it you know then,1
oh i do i really do i think it's great,1
uh well like one week she'll work three days and i'll work two and the,1
it is well both of ours is school age but we don't want to miss,1
yes i think it's great i really and i look for more of that in,1
yes oh i do too yes,1
yeah but i can remem- remember back growing up my mother i mean it was,1
oh i do too,1
know the feeling well it wa- okay and i sure will,1
hello,1
hi this is Lisa,1
yeah i got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though,1
-t's kind of an easy thing to talk about,1
um i think you have to push one and then we can start recording it,1
yes i know because_1,1
i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there,1
because_1 women are in every field now i mean i can't think of a field,1
i know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with,1
hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue i mean people will just,1
uh-huh exactly not what color you are how old you are what if your male,1
exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your age or,1
and then,1
also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as,1
is it,1
that would be great,1
or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors,1
and sh- you know we could send her messages and and she kept in touch,1
i mean that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it,1
so i think that's real nice too to come up with different options do you,1
do you,1
do you work like half days or half weeks or,1
oh is oh that's great,1
oh that's wonderful,1
oh no i think yeah my son's just in day care but even that they,1
i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be,1
plus i bet it cuts  cuts down on your absenteeism because_1 you've got two,1
um-hum oh yeah i have to plan way in advance because or what i've done,1
so that's real helpful so you don't  you know have to do it during,1
oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of,1
i think there's still some discrimination there where as you know men and wor- women,1
mean you can see that it's wrong and you just wanna make it right but,1
yeah i think it's getting better not worse,1
