public service uh,0
yeah i've never had any uh,0
i think uh,0
yeah or maybe uh,0
have uh,0
you know self uh,0
but uh,0
yeah exactly,0
but uh,0
yeah i agree with that,0
yeah it's,0
yeah,0
yeah that is a problem,0
but it's uh,0
yeah yeah,0
yeah he's he's about my favorite,0
yeah tackle and stuff,0
yeah i've noticed they they're now,0
oh yeah,0
uh-huh yeah,0
yeah uh-huh,0
yeah what uh,0
yeah so so are you a,0
yeah that's,0
right on,0
um yeah,0
and uh,0
yeah right,0
yeah,0
yeah huh,0
oh i see,0
but um,0
but um,0
oh okay,0
hi um yeah i'd,1
and is,1
right right is there,1
right right and does,1
yeah and it was,1
um uh usually engineers,1
uh other times it,1
uh well i was,1
um and seaso- really,1
that's,1
that's true and and,1
the men often have,1
that's true so um,1
okay and and,1
yeah ours were ours,1
yeah i don't know,1
oh it's been nice,1
okay hi,1
well i work in,1
we can't even well,1
so it really doesn't,1
not formally,1
but it's kind of,1
and we prepare a,1
yes now you know,1
ice storms of course,1
unless it's an ex-,1
it with the,1
but then usually in,1
it,1
not really i think,1
but i'm not in,1
yes pretty much i'm,1
y- yeah but there's,1
it's just you know,1
you know what i,1
well that pretty much,1
okay uh first um,1
she had a fall,1
that was even harder,1
change of location and,1
and um that was,1
not just merely had,1
yeah well my uh,1
than just delegate it,1
getting down together and,1
finding a place and,1
and they i know,1
she was very well,1
and i think that,1
um i- i- i,1
and um i mean,1
i i th- i,1
it wasn't necessarily you,1
were very interested that,1
what everything would hinge,1
yeah you know it's,1
you know uh now,1
um i- matter of,1
we we don't we,1
yeah yeah i i,1
you know that that,1
any of the grandparents,1
yeah but uh i'm,1
especially where they've had,1
you know we may,1
money seems to be,1
you know perhaps if,1
the qua- but actually,1
okay well,1
okay all right hey,1
well of course it's,1
i'd be very very,1
and uh we were,1
i was personally acquainted,1
so i was very,1
had fell and needed,1
it had to be,1
and it was really,1
deal we were not,1
nursing home that we,1
but it's really a,1
you know is there,1
my mother excuse me,1
that's great,1
that's right i-,1
you were very fortunate,1
absolutely un- unfortunately at,1
responsibilities like that seem,1
and uh it's usually,1
and uh fortunately we,1
my mother also was,1
we were lucky in,1
that nursing home life,1
that's great,1
um-hum that'd be tough,1
yeah i think a,1
sure absolutely and people,1
yeah just because they're,1
right that's just a,1
i think your right,1
me i'm in the,1
and i don't know,1
a new solution we,1
but the new idea,1
from what i've heard,1
uh permits you know,1
now is that place,1
well i know from,1
you know the law,1
uh everybody has to,1
you know take everything,1
certainly it would seem,1
it still only in,1
yeah there there was,1
jeez,1
oh you were oh,1
yes it's a heck,1
we finally got a,1
you too bye,1
{alrighty} uh i guess,1
as well as what,1
does your work entitle,1
very,1
yeah it's uh having,1
lost a lot of,1
and a lot of,1
and uh we are,1
uh this is air,1
and so w- w-,1
uh that uh scrub,1
uh to a certain,1
and so what we,1
as you know the,1
the Sherman facility we,1
closer to but still,1
uh Tom Jones our,1
uh but it's uh,1
because the the system,1
any bad stuff so,1
uh first thing we,1
possibly,1
we have hoods we,1
and uh we can't,1
but not so not,1
which is totally legal,1
expenditures because_1 it can,1
this has been an,1
yeah glad to see,1
exactly and that's um,1
i've enjoy- exactly i've,1
well i guess without,1
uh y- yeah you,1
uh what you call,1
i wonder when they're,1
uh well actually you,1
well basically what happens,1
be it electrical as,1
uh you had and,1
oh i'm not exactly,1
in the process of,1
w- well did you,1
i mean there's uh,1
and i understand now,1
service stations are going,1
to catch this Freon,1
and therefore you won't,1
no that's true,1
spending summers at my,1
no shoes socks shirts,1
uh i mean from,1
and i develop a,1
or for that matter,1
about_1 catching some disease,1
i tell you funny,1
uh TI sent me,1
town kind of backwoods,1
but uh i checked,1
and after i signed,1
it's contaminated,1
he said now we,1
i- i'll see that,1
well the next morning,1
oh well th- they,1
it's uh some kind,1
and it they got,1
well maybe not quite,1
but this uh bacteria,1
pipe system or water,1
and they tried flushing,1
i've often wondered now,1
bubbling nicely you know,1
yes and yet even,1
well i'm beginning to,1
then all of a,1
my gosh it's okay,1
as a matter of,1
neither have i,1
i've often wondered about,1
air pollution,1
uh they used to,1
no they did away,1
the people that were,1
and for n- uh,1
um-hum well now here's,1
and yet they haven't,1
uh-huh yeah t- t-,1
well i um i,1
is that right well,1
as a matter of,1
-/diesel] uh diesel engine,1
and uh they used,1
uh the induction ports,1
and although they were,1
and they did aw-,1
well now course in,1
now could be that,1
i don't know what,1
a little more stricter,1
well what do you,1
yeah i i i,1
with all the uh,1
causing acid rain and,1
ozone yeah ozo- ozone,1
well i was i,1
but on the other,1
um i took a,1
i- it was actually,1
oh okay so it,1
oh okay i well,1
right which happens all,1
i i'm more worried,1
all that kind of,1
but the ozone i,1
we we can't clean,1
burning and everything else,1
i- i don't kn-,1
and i just have,1
i don't know this,1
ozone,1
naw i can believe,1
y- you pr- you,1
go- well it's,1
the action over the,1
jeez well that's scary,1
i it it worries,1
you kn- and i,1
yeah well it's it's,1
i don't know if,1
yeah i i couldn't,1
right that's about what,1
and they s- s-,1
i don't know,1
uh you had to,1
and there are about,1
and i think Louisiana,1
i think that's the,1
yeah a- and i,1
i- it wasn't serving,1
i mean you look,1
and you tell me,1
yeah i mea- you,1
because it was uh,1
what one forty one,1
i never did like,1
cold w-,1
yeah i had a,1
i don't know liquefy,1
but speaking of cars,1

uh-huh um you know,1
so i i- predominantly,1
yeah well they're um,1
they their attire is,1
it's one of those,1
yeah yeah so i'm,1
i guess we've discussed,1
have you done a,1
oh okay i'm not,1
but mostly in Texas,1
i've camped in a,1
oh gosh yes uh,1
oh we di- my,1
we had a lot,1
oh no no i've,1
ooh no no,1
shaking the scorpions out,1
oh me neither me,1
when my fa- when,1
we camped at the,1
and the and the,1
oh how awful,1
oh that's miserable,1
yeah it's i- y-,1
oh i know i,1
now i wish i,1
that's true,1
so it it it,1
because_1 my our family,1
that's nice you know,1
what else,1
i think that's just,1
well it's been nice,1
bye-bye,1
no i haven't been,1
but uh my family,1
it's near Austin,1
have you ever been,1
when i go camping,1
i'm not really into,1
God,1
i have some friends,1
and they just find,1
doesn't sound like a,1
no kidding no kidding,1
yeah the one g-,1
we stayed in Galveston,1
and there were some,1
yeah pretty bad but,1
yeah well children aren't,1
oh gosh it makes,1
my fiance and i,1
mainly because he's a,1
and it'd be nice,1
that is nice,1
no kidding it really,1
nice talking to you,1
this is Archie,1
have you seen Dancing,1
have you ever lived,1
have you ever visited,1
i think it was,1
well i lived in,1
yeah is is fairly,1
uh and i had,1
well the interesting thing,1
and and and i,1
no i've heard i've,1
no you must really,1
we- isn't isn't Sleeping,1
do you do you,1
he's a the movie,1
and he does uh,1
KLIF anyway it's on,1
ten or twelve years,1
he anyway he it's,1
pick up my daughter,1
uh the question is,1
do you know who,1
a little piece of,1
he he on Murphy,1
yes he's,1
he's Eldon her housepainter,1
believe that,1
that's that's one of,1
you know with the,1
yeah real scruffy looking,1
i don't know how,1
well i don't know,1
don't we do that,1
hi Archie i'm Sharon,1
yeah i've seen that,1
i thought the story,1
no i haven't,1
um i've visited the,1
could be i- i,1
ha- have you been,1
terrain,1
that's true i agree,1
did you,1
have you seen Sleeping,1
y- you have to,1
i do i go,1
it's suspenseful i don't,1
um the other one,1
yeah somebody in South,1
i think that i,1
he wanted to direct,1
whether it won all,1
i think that i,1
yeah who no i,1
oh he does,1
as a recurring character,1
oh no now see,1
you think so i,1
well the first thing,1
if privacy is something,1
one thing and if,1
invasion of the first,1
finds out information about,1
um obviously everyday,1
right it turned out,1
from from personal parties,1
oh that that's a,1
because i'm usually so,1
i think they prey,1
inherent politeness on the,1
well presumably those who,1
oh i don't know,1
things that invade that,1
where you do know,1
i can't talk about,1
um-hum well you must,1
yes yes you'd b-,1
yes i did i,1
yeah and i one,1
uh you know just,1
you know full cash,1
virtually anyone any hacker,1
and that hacker just,1
um-hum i also hm,1
that occurred to me,1
but i realized i,1
i realize that that,1
i can take that,1
things are quite different,1
um so there's not,1
as a as a,1
you know it it,1
and people would leave,1
whereas in this country,1
people start paying attention,1
but it does mean,1
and which isn't al-,1
and they've really um,1
there's hope i actually,1
because_1 anyone can be,1
there's this invisible barrier,1
well the class- the,1
which is more intrusive,1
what i look like,1
any f- anyone any,1
i i think i,1
typical thing that happens,1
so my immediate reaction,1
uh probably seven or,1
commercial soli- solicitations primarily,1
and i think that's,1
and and uh that,1
um i guess i'm,1
typically feeling invaded in,1
thi- one that you,1
to s- to surmise,1
well i guess although,1
i well that's a,1
um if your defining,1
i don't have a,1
uh the the other,1
bec- right because you,1
that would be an,1
and then i would,1
incorrect things that's even,1
right as a person,1
and i guess that,1
oh that's interesting,1
but but no concept,1
oh th- that would,1
that'd be culturally,1
that that is true,1
that's interesting are th-,1
so that's another example,1
good and yourself,1
pardon me,1
i'm in Lewisville,1
little bit,1
that's a hard issue,1
uh rollback the taxes,1
uh twenty dollars a,1
and as far as,1
you know Texas is,1
pardon me,1
that's true,1
yeah i know that's,1
i think we're gonna,1
are you,1
i think were gonna,1
i think i think,1
you know uh that,1
but uh i wouldn't,1
i don't know that,1
pluses and minuses because_1,1
are economically disadvantaged won't,1
i think the only,1
that's the only way,1
and they should give,1
i mean when i,1
i'm a mathematician,1
pardon me,1
i don't know there,1
i mean,1
yeah where i you,1
so it all depends,1
the way people are,1
but uh ba- back,1
i can see that,1
most states have it,1
way uh way financing,1
which just matter of,1
no it didn't,1
which means there's a,1
uh decided that uh,1
actually no um,1
i'm surprised that m-,1
uh which is a,1
um i'm surprised it's,1
well considering the national,1
for the national budget,1
and you're gonna think,1
it's interesting i don't,1
they bring in half,1
that's about it i,1
seven percent or something,1
how's that,1
that's the way to,1
no,1
and so when you,1
yeah i think what,1
because_1 when they got,1
uh well for like,1
and you know they're,1
yeah well i don't,1
quite a quite a,1
Arch how are you,1
where am i calling,1
where are you,1
Lewisville okay i'm in,1
what do you think,1
but we're not funding,1
that's right but just,1
i mean i think,1
well they're already talking,1
that's true,1
but like in Garland,1
like in Garland they,1
so and i like,1
so just distribute it,1
oh so you picked,1
what do you think,1
but didn't they pass,1
so what about your,1
think they're hitting you,1
which just keeps accumulating,1
and the city tax,1
i don't even know,1
because_1 i wouldn't want,1
so it wouldn't be,1
federal tax is okay,1
state tax you can,1
you don't think it,1
we don't need anymore,1
but we can do,1
par-,1
lots and lots of,1
but still i work,1
and a lot of,1
you know socioeconomic areas,1
and i mean they've,1
you know it's just,1
and the like a,1
that he,1
yeah it is oh,1
okay well ta- talk,1
uh on the scale,1
i'm not totally i'm,1
one of these people,1
that everyone should have,1
no they don't they,1
yeah they might be,1
i've never even bought,1
it really is uh,1
yeah exactly right it,1
and they're illegal i,1
that's true,1
i think they ought,1
right yeah you cannot,1
oh yeah they do,1
they think it's ridiculous,1
looked like antlers i,1
but i guess that's,1
that's my opinion on,1
uh i think we,1
uh how do you,1
some people do i,1
yeah there's a lot,1
i'm from California my,1
they he had to,1
it's,1
like the bumper sticker,1
people that are uh,1
yeah i have have,1
God gun control it's,1
some of them are,1
yeah Marge i don't,1
i'm not sure,1
i let's see,1
y- yeah we just,1
have you ever got,1
offering a service or,1
they're introducing some new,1
normally when they call,1
that was the big,1
and invariably just about,1
and you're trying to,1
or you hear somebody,1
even had some of,1
they're voice activated and,1
what i would love,1
we've got a thing,1
i think a law,1
but if they're going,1
that's about that as,1
i put a stop,1
peddling products if i,1
now i agree with,1
pursue their religion of,1
i'm on my turf,1
now the part about,1
i don't know how,1
wonder if there'd be,1
but i consider invasion,1
a harassment in itself,1
i believe we've pretty,1
i'm drawing the blank,1
uh pretty close to,1
and take it easy,1
that is that one,1
that's true or the,1
um-hum yeah see i,1
so yeah i do,1
i agree with you,1
let me see,1
yeah that's true living,1
uh but they still,1
and i really hate,1
and um gosh it,1
and uh i've read,1
yeah yeah no i-,1
and and it's their,1
and i don't know,1
and wanting to uh,1
yeah that's true yeah,1
but you know i,1
instead of stop,1
hm well what else,1
i know but i,1
you talked about the,1
and i can't remember,1
and i thought yeah,1
oh goodness okay is,1
pretty cl-,1
well it was nice,1
okay thanks bye,1
okay um well i've,1
and we're in our,1
we've lived in the,1
well it's it's not,1
i know i i,1
so i'm not sure,1
but then for the,1
but uh we've done,1
uh but uh i,1
and they have sold,1
and the the lady,1
so i I suppose,1
well i'm not really,1
because uh apparently the,1
but that was a,1
and in inside that,1
and so any shifting,1
and of course the,1
no it uh it,1
yeah but i think,1
yeah but uh well,1
and once they get,1
and makes it more,1
uh potentially that's supposed,1
right uh is yours,1
yeah so that's and,1
and uh i just,1
yeah so you know,1
yeah so well it,1
okay thank you you,1
we just bought our,1
oh so y- you're,1

well do you have,1
so did it look,1
oh so that's that's,1
we really like our,1
